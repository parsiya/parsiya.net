You answer the challenge, send it out and if correct they will send the next level (at least that is what they say).
There are three categories: Reverse Engineering, Web and Vulnerabilities.
The first Reverse Engineering challenge was quite easy. But it was level 1 and I do not expect anti-debugging techniques. Let's see about the next level.
Anyway, Enjoy. Linkie.</description></item></channel></rss>
