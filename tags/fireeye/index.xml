This is just not the solution but other ways that I tried. This was a great learning experience for me so I am writing this post to document everything I tried. As a result, this post is somewhat long.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you have any feedback, please let me know. I spent a lot of time on this writeup and I am always happy to learn new stuff. My email and twitter handle are in the sidebar.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I am a bit late to the party. There &lt;del>were two&lt;/del> are now other three solutions posted (that I know of). Check them out.&lt;/p>

I know I should have updated more frequently but lazyness prevails.&lt;br>
Anyway, I was busy doing Fireeye's FlARE challenges for a month or so (it was depressing to see people finish in 10 hours :). You can find the challenges at &lt;a href="http://flare-on.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">http://flare-on.com&lt;/a>. I learned a lot doing them. They will release solutions in 2 weeks. I am also working on a writeup which I will release then. I think it will be interesting as it will be a n00b's perspective.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
