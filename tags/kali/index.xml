At the moment, guests can comment and comments
do not need to be approved (unless they have links). Hopefully there won't be
much spam to sink the occasional comment that I think will be posted.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Update from 2020: Comments without approval were a mistake. I got so much spam
and harassment.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Note: I just wanted to make it work in a hurry. There are probably better ways
of doing this.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I stumbled upon the very useful tool
&lt;a href="http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/soft/memfetch.tgz" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">memfetch&lt;/a> by the talented
&lt;em>lcamtuf&lt;/em>. The utility is quite old (from 2003 if I recall correctly) and I
could not build it using the provided makefile.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
