This is a legitimate question. Many have heard of the highly publicized attacks against AES-CBC (CRIME, BEAST etc) and lean towards RC4.
If asked (granted no one asks me), my answer would be: If you can control web servers (not feasible in all situations) and users' browsers
(almost impossible), upgrade to TLS 1.2 and go with AES-GCM. However, not many browsers supported these and to be honest, more users trumps loss
of security in many cases.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
