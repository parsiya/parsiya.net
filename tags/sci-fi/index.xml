The concept of linguistic malware was interesting and ahead of its time.
I noticed that the term &amp;quot;Virus&amp;quot; was used correctly in the book as the malware
was not propagating between people (then it would become a worm).
Although I suspect it was due to the fact that most people (read almost everyone)
calls any malware a &amp;quot;virus&amp;quot;. Nevertheless, it was a very enjoyable read.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
