However, it is still in the repository.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I finally realized that I need an image popup plugin. The image plugins that I usually use do not support this. They are fine for normal images but not for larger ones. When I see a screenshot of a tool, I want to be able to zoom in. In my quest I looked at a few plugins and methods and finally decided to use &lt;a href="https://github.com/ctdk/octopress-image-popup" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;https://github.com/ctdk/octopress-image-popup&lt;/a&gt;. It creates resized thumbnails automatically and the installation procedure is short and simple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, it did not work for me out of the box. I created a test post with just an image and while the plugin worked, there are things that I did not like about it.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
