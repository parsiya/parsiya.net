&lt;p>I did not blog for almost exactly a year from July 28th 2016 to July 8th 2017.&lt;/p>

I am not like that, I want to document what I do for future reference right now before I forget.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Great Hiatus</title><link>https://parsiya.net/blog/2016-08-01-the-great-hiatus/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Aug 2016 02:04:23 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://parsiya.net/blog/2016-08-01-the-great-hiatus/</guid><description>&lt;p>This is a blog from the future.
