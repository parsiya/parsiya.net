&lt;/h1>&lt;p>Instead of creating an index manually for Github, I am using a Hugo blog for my knowledge base (a.k.a. &lt;code>Parsia-Clone&lt;/code>). This blog is about my flow and how I have semi-automated the process. Demo site is at &lt;a href="https://parsiya.io" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://parsiya.io&lt;/a> (it's served in plaintext because I am making rapid changes and do not want to invalidate CloudFront's cache after every push).&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="flow">Flow
&lt;a class="header-link" href="#flow">&lt;svg class="fill-current o-60 hover-accent-color-light" height="22px" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="22px" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">&lt;path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/>&lt;path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76 0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71 0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71 0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76 0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/>&lt;/svg>&lt;/a>
&lt;/h1>&lt;p>Flow is pretty simple:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Create the page bundle directory and page in the clone with &lt;code>hugo new&lt;/code>. I usually create it under &lt;code>categories\main-category-name&lt;/code>. The command will look like:
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;code>hugo new categories\research\hacking-the-gibson\index.md&lt;/code>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Run &lt;code>hugo serve&lt;/code> to preview the page during the edit.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Fill front matter and write the page in &lt;code>index.md&lt;/code>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Any resources such as pictures and files can be in the same directory. This helps in two ways, they can be referenced in the page (like pictures) and seen on Github (like config files).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When done, &lt;code>git add/commit/push&lt;/code> the clone inside the &lt;code>content&lt;/code> directory.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>???&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Profit. See updated blog, built and deployed by &lt;code>Travis CI&lt;/code>.&lt;/li>

Not having done this before, I encountered some pitfalls. Additionally I had two extra problems:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The structure of the blog is different from most Hugo deployments. &lt;a href="https://github.com/parsiya/Parsia-Clone" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Parsia-Clone&lt;/a> only contains the &lt;code>content&lt;/code> directory. Parents and everything else are in the &lt;a href="https://github.com/parsiya/Parsiya.io" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">parsiya.io&lt;/a> repo. So while we push to &lt;code>Parsia-Clone&lt;/code>, we need to clone &lt;code>parsiya.io&lt;/code> and build the repository there.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I am hosting it out of an S3 bucket. All other examples were using github pages.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Update November 2020:&lt;/strong> As of late November 2020, I have switched to Github
actions for both &lt;code>parsiya.net&lt;/code> and &lt;code>parsiya.io&lt;/code>. Please see
&lt;a href="https://github.com/parsiya/Parsia-Clone/blob/main/.github/workflows/deploy.ymlOLD" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">deploy.ymlOLD&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Update February 2021:&lt;/strong> parsiya.io is now hosted on github pages with a custom
domain instead of an S3 bucket. Please see the workflow file at
&lt;a href="https://github.com/parsiya/Parsia-Clone/blob/main/.github/workflows/gh-pages.yml" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gh-pages.yml&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Great Hiatus</title><link>https://parsiya.net/blog/2018-03-01-the-great-hiatus/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Mar 2018 22:22:51 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://parsiya.net/blog/2018-03-01-the-great-hiatus/</guid><description>&lt;p>This is copied to a blog entry on Aug 1 2016.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I did not blog for almost exactly a year from July 28th 2016 to July 8th 2017.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is not something new, if you look at my blog dates you can see I work in clusters. I do a few blogs about something interesting in quick succession and then don't do anything for a while.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You could call this a problem. Some people recommend holding off posts and then publishing them more steadily. I am not like that, I want to document what I do for future reference right now before I forget.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Great Hiatus</title><link>https://parsiya.net/blog/2016-08-01-the-great-hiatus/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Aug 2016 02:04:23 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://parsiya.net/blog/2016-08-01-the-great-hiatus/</guid><description>&lt;p>This is a blog from the future.

I know I will end up paying more than what I already do but I pay few bucks each month. Each month I pay one dollar for two hosted zones and another dollar or so for the bandwidth. Even if I was still in my home country, I would have been able to pay this as it is less than a large pizza even where I lived.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you are interested in free hosting alternatives, you can use &lt;a href="https://gohugo.io/tutorials/github-pages-blog/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Github-pages&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://gohugo.io/tutorials/hosting-on-bitbucket/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bitbucket&lt;/a> or just go with the excellent &lt;a href="https://gitlab.com/pages/hugo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gitlab-Pages&lt;/a> (which supports Hugo and whole lot of other static website generators natively).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It took me a lot of tries and probably burning a good amount of money on Cloudfront invalidation requests (otherwise I had to wait for a day or so to see the changes) but it finally worked. The trick was to setup the origin policy during creation of the distribution as it cannot be modified through the web portal after that.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Burp part five is still on hold for now because I am doing something else.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Hugo Octopress Update</title><link>https://parsiya.net/blog/2016-04-03-hugo-octopress-update/</link><pubDate>Sun, 03 Apr 2016 13:13:39 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://parsiya.net/blog/2016-04-03-hugo-octopress-update/</guid><description>&lt;p>I have made a good number of changes to the &lt;a href="https://github.com/parsiya/hugo-octopress" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hugo-Octopress&lt;/a> theme. As I have been using the theme more and more, I have realized there were a bunch of bugs (some were pointed out on Github).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Apart from Bugs, I had hardcoded too many settings in the theme. For example, modifying the text in the sidebar could only be accomplished by changing the sidebar template. Ideally user should not need to modify anything in the theme and it should be customizable by just using the config file.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the end I created a bunch of issues on Github and then closed them myself. I am not quite sure if this is correct &lt;code>git&lt;/code> but eh :D&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Archive Page in Hugo</title><link>https://parsiya.net/blog/2016-02-14-archive-page-in-hugo/</link><pubDate>Sun, 14 Feb 2016 20:52:45 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://parsiya.net/blog/2016-02-14-archive-page-in-hugo/</guid><description>&lt;p>This is a re-hash of my answer on Hugo forums about creating a custom archive page.

&lt;p>Creating a custom archive page in Hugo is pretty simple. I think there are better ways to do this but this works as of version 0.15.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>From Octopress to Hugo</title><link>https://parsiya.net/blog/2016-02-02-from-octopress-to-hugo/</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 Feb 2016 22:58:26 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://parsiya.net/blog/2016-02-02-from-octopress-to-hugo/</guid><description>&lt;p>In &lt;a href="https://parsiya.net/blog/2016-01-31-why-hugo/" title="Why Hugo?">my previous post&lt;/a> I talked about why I moved from Octopress to Hugo. You can also see the last archive of my Octopress blog (previously a private repo on Bitbucket) on &lt;a href="https://github.com/parsiya/Octopress-Blog" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">github&lt;/a> and this is the new site. If I had wanted to use an already existing Hugo theme, it would have not taken more than a few hours.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this post I am going to talk about how I managed the migration and any interesting things that I encountered in the process. I will also introduce the &lt;a href="https://github.com/parsiya/hugo-octopress/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hugo-Octopress&lt;/a> theme (you are looking at it), which is the classic Octopress theme ported to Hugo. If you like what you see, please go ahead and use it. If there are any issues please use the &lt;a href="https://github.com/parsiya/Hugo-Octopress/issues" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Github issue tracker&lt;/a> or contact me another way. I will try my best to fix them but please remember that I am not a developer and do not know much about css :).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Why Hugo?</title><link>https://parsiya.net/blog/2016-01-31-why-hugo/</link><pubDate>Sun, 31 Jan 2016 20:22:19 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://parsiya.net/blog/2016-01-31-why-hugo/</guid><description>&lt;p>As you may have noticed (well no one reads this so I am fine), I have moved from &lt;a href="http://octopress.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Octopress&lt;/a> to &lt;a href="https://gohugo.io" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hugo&lt;/a>. I have been trying to make this change for a while but due to laziness and some other matters it did not happen. I am going to talk about why I decided on the move and what I did.

However, it is still in the repository.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I finally realized that I need an image popup plugin. The image plugins that I usually use do not support this. They are fine for normal images but not for larger ones. When I see a screenshot of a tool, I want to be able to zoom in. In my quest I looked at a few plugins and methods and finally decided to use &lt;a href="https://github.com/ctdk/octopress-image-popup" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://github.com/ctdk/octopress-image-popup&lt;/a>. It creates resized thumbnails automatically and the installation procedure is short and simple.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, it did not work for me out of the box. I created a test post with just an image and while the plugin worked, there are things that I did not like about it.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Amazon S3 and CSS</title><link>https://parsiya.net/blog/2014-04-22-amazon-s3-and-css/</link><pubDate>Tue, 22 Apr 2014 14:03:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://parsiya.net/blog/2014-04-22-amazon-s3-and-css/</guid><description>After I deployed my blog to Amazon S3, I realized that there was no CSS applied to the pages. In Octopress, the look and feel of website is managed by stylesheets/screen.css. It was fine in rake preview but not on the S3 bucket. I looked around for a few hours to no avail.

It was really easy to redirect everything to cryptogangsta.com. parsiya.net, www.parsiya.net and www.cryptogangsta.com should all point to cryptogangsta.com.
I have decided (for n-th time) to start updating this blog.
