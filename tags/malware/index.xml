Malware adventure is copied at two places:
https://github.com/parsiya/malwareadventure https://github.com/parsiya/Parsia-Code/tree/master/malware-adventure A fork of PAWS is here:
https://github.com/Moonbase59/PAWS I finally caved in and started to push some of my code to github bitbucket. It is located at https://bitbucket.org/parsiya and is almost empty ;).
This is Malware Adventure. It's a small adventure game I wrote using PAWS. PAWS is Pyhton Adventure Writing System by Roger Plowman.</description></item><item><title>Snow Crash and Malware</title><link>https://parsiya.net/blog/2013-09-23-snow-crash-and-malware/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 Sep 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://parsiya.net/blog/2013-09-23-snow-crash-and-malware/</guid><description>So I finished &amp;quot;Snow Crash&amp;quot; and it was quite nice. The concept of linguistic malware was interesting and ahead of its time. I noticed that the term &amp;quot;Virus&amp;quot; was used correctly in the book as the malware was not propagating between people (then it would become a worm). Although I suspect it was due to the fact that most people (read almost everyone) calls any malware a &amp;quot;virus&amp;quot;. Nevertheless, it was a very enjoyable read.</description></item></channel></rss>
