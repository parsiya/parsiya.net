Although I do not have many blog posts, they are usually long and contain images and code. Also it does not support incremental generation which means that every time I wanted to push my blog, I had to re-create the blog from scratch. I could live with this because I only do new posts every once in a while so waiting a couple of minutes before deploying the website is not inconvenient.</li><li>My main problem was during content creation. Every time I wanted to look at my changes I had to wait 30 seconds and then refresh the page manually to see the changes. This became very inconvenient. I started creating my posts in a local markdown editor (with preview support) and then copy/pasting it into the actual markdown file and looking at the result. However, modifying posts still took a lot of time and effort.</li><li>Octopress was written in Ruby. I am not a developer but I have written Ruby code (some of which are closer in your everyday lives than they appear <code>;)</code>) but as you can see in my <a href=https://parsiya.net/blog/2015-07-26-image-popup-and-octopress/ title="Image Popup and Octopress">imgpopup plugin post</a>, creating plugins for Octopress was a pain for me.</li></ol><h3 id=octopress-the-good-parts>Octopress the Good Parts

I really like it.</li><li>It does what it claims. You can install it using a gem and set up your posts and it is probably good to go. Most probably you will not encounter a bug.</li><li>Posts can be written in Markdown.</li><li>It has a lot of plugins for everyday use out of the box. There are plugins for code, images, videos and tweets.</li></ol><p>Does this mean that Octopress is a bad static website generator? Not really but it did not work for me.</p><h3 id=what-i-wanted>What I Wanted

Most static website generators supports code highlight by default but I really like code and image captions. Either it should be supported or I could create my own plugin.</li><li>Have the Octopress classic theme or a similar theme.</li><li>Allows me to migrate my posts from Octopress. In other words, support writing posts in Markdown. This is supported by almost all static website generators.</li></ol><p>I could go to <a href=https://jekyllrb.com/ target=_blank rel="noreferrer noopener">Jekyll</a> and almost everything would work without problems but creating plugins would be a pain. After all Octopress is built on top of Jekyll. Some call it a fancy front-end for Jekyll but I disagree.</p><p>I shopped around looking for static website generator and my final choices were <a href=http://blog.getpelican.com/ target=_blank rel="noreferrer noopener">Pelican</a> and <a href=https://gohugo.io target=_blank rel="noreferrer noopener">Hugo</a>.</p><h4 id=pelican>Pelican
<a class=header-link href=#pelican><svg class="fill-current o-60 hover-accent-color-light" height="22" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="22" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a></h4><p>This <a href=https://jakevdp.github.io/blog/2013/05/07/migrating-from-octopress-to-pelican/ target=_blank rel="noreferrer noopener">post</a> titles "Migrating from Octopress to Pelican" by Jake Vanderplas was really helpful and that was one of the reasons I almost chose Pelican and even modified most of my posts to work in Pelican.</p><ol><li>Pelican is reasonably fast. I was amazed after I changed something in my post and saved and the page in browser auto-refreshed with changes within a few seconds.</li><li>It is written in Python. Nowadays I write most of my code in Python but creating the plugins were a pain. I fiddled with them for a few days and gave up after I could not create what I wanted.</li></ol><ul><li>There is a figure with caption plugin called <a href=https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-plugins/tree/master/better_figures_and_images target=_blank rel="noreferrer noopener">better figures and images</a>.</li><li>There is no code caption plugin. I tried creating my own but I got lost. The reason was that because the code is not a one liner (it has an opening tag and closing tag with code int between), I had to create a Markdown pre-processor. There is an <a href=https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-plugins/blob/master/liquid_tags/include_code.py target=_blank rel="noreferrer noopener">Include_code plugin</a> that creates a highlighted code block with caption but it only supports pulling from a file. That would not work for me.</li></ul><ol start=3><li>Someone has already done it. <a href=https://github.com/duilio/pelican-octopress-theme target=_blank rel="noreferrer noopener">https://github.com/duilio/pelican-octopress-theme</a></li><li>I only needed to modify some tags but it mostly worked.</li></ol><p>Pelican was a really good fit. However, the pains that I had to go through in order to create a codeblock with captions plugin (Markdown preprocessor what?), made me skip this and go for Hugo.</p><h5 id=hugo>Hugo
<a class=header-link href=#hugo><svg class="fill-current o-60 hover-accent-color-light" height="22" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="22" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/></svg></a></h5><p>I will talk about why I chose Hugo and the migration in length in the next post. But for now let's see if Hugo is a good fit for my requirements.</p><ol><li>It is reasonably fast. Similar to Pelican when I modified a Markdown file, the browser auto-refreshed and I could see the changes in a few seconds.</li><li>Hugo had neither. However it supports <a href=https://gohugo.io/extras/shortcodes/ target=_blank rel="noreferrer noopener">shortcodes</a> and I could create both in a few minutes. I will talk about what I did and how I did it in the migration post.</li><li>Hugo does not have the classic Octopress theme and this was a big weakness compared to Pelican. But as you can see I made my own. It was a good exercise in learning about the inner workings of Hugo and <code>css</code>.</li><li>Not only Hugo supports Markdown, it has an <a href=https://gohugo.io/commands/hugo_import_jekyll/ target=_blank rel="noreferrer noopener">import Jekyll</a> module which works for Octopress. It seems like a good number of people have moved to Hugo from Jekyll because there are a good number Jekyll themes ported to Hugo. For a list of Hugo themes you can visit <a href=https://github.com/spf13/hugoThemes/ target=_blank rel="noreferrer noopener">this repo</a>.</li></ol><h3 id=conclusion>Conclusion
