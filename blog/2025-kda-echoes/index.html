enthusiastic and started season 3 <code>Call of the Cyber Duty</code> in real time with
almost zero Kusto background and did the first three before I realized, this is
much harder than I imagined.</p><p>I started from season 1 to learn and do the challenges. Here are the first eight

Kusto functionalities and tricks that can be used to solve the challenge. I
didn't notice them in my season 3 run.</p><p>Then I look at the tables. We can get the table columns and types with a query
like this:</p><pre tabindex=0><code>TableName

syntax issues, AKA "I want to filter A and B, write a Kusto query for me", but
not great for the actual solves. I usually added all the data, table schemas and
other insights from training to a markdown file and asked different models in
GitHub Copilot Chat to solve. It actually worked for the first 2-3 challenges,

Hint2: Exposing the Leaker

observe the changes in usage patterns across the entire attacker network.

I can sense your concern, as rumors of our true intentions have reached the ears
of the KDA. But fear not, my loyal comrades, for we shall not waver from our
path! If anything, we shall intensify our efforts until the KDA crumbles beneath
our feet.

I cannot share too much at this time, but rest assured, we are running our
&#34;smoke tests&#34;, both figuratively and quite literally.

They shall expose the KDA&#39;s weaknesses and herald its epic downfall.

Now, let us address the matter of my well-being. I understand that there is a
great deal of curiosity regarding my safety.

Let me assure you, it was all a matter of impeccable timing. No doubt my
connecting flight was an experience of a lifetime!

Too bad my luggage failed to join me on this thrilling journey! :)

But fear not, my friends, leaving things to chance is not my style. I have
assembled a team of loyal bodyguards, who move with me like elusive phantoms,
ensuring my invincibility. At any given time, at least two of them discreetly
shadow my every move, even during my exhilarating runs through the city. Truly,
I feel untouchable. And let me tell you, this city is a hidden gem! It offers an
abundance of marvelous spots where one can indulge in a refreshing shake after
conquering a breathtaking 10K run. It is a perfect blend of mischief and
rejuvenation, a delightful concoction that fuels my strength.

So, my fellow rogues, let us keep our eyes fixed on the target. I will reveal
more details about our plans in due time.

Prepare yourselves to witness the spectacular downfall of the KDA, as we
relentlessly drill into its core at full speed!
