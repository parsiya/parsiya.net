I had a 30 minute talk about Blockchain security at [NoVA Hackers](https://twitter.com/novahackers) on March 12th 2018.

NoVA Hackers is a monthly security meetup for in northern Virginia. Very welcoming event.

Hopefully I can do more presentations as I learn more.

As usual, please let me know where I messed up.
