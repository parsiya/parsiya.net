So I wrote about [Tineola](https://github.com/tineola/tineola) for our corporate blog. The editors fixed my words so it sounds fancy and actually English. You can read it here:

In the meanwhile, I have been doing [Gophercises](https://gophercises.com/exercises/) by [Jon Calhoun](https://www.calhoun.io). I am up to 16. I am documenting my learned lessons in the readme of each directory. I will add them all together and put them somewhere here or in [hackingwithgo.com](http://hackingwithgo.com). You can see the code here:
