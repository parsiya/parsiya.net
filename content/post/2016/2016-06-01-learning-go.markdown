I have decided to learn Go (or Golang). I went through the [Tour of Go](https://tour.golang.org/) and made some notes. Some of the items/code are directly copy pasted from there. The notes are just a cheatsheet to help me look things up quickly while learning. I will update that page as I learn more.

You can see the notes at [https://parsiya.net/go/]({{< relref "go.markdown" >}} "Go Notes").
