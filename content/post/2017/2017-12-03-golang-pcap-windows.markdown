I was trying to solve a challenge where the "hidden data" were in ICMP echo payloads. I decided to do it in Go but there were some hiccups on the way. Here are my notes in case (most likely) future me or someone else needs to do the same.

Code is in my clone at:

# gopacket
[gopacket][gopacket-godoc] is the official Go library for packet manipulation.
It also supports reading and writing pcap files through `gopacket/pcap`.

I started following [this tutorial from dev dungeon][dev-dungeon-go] (skipped
the capturing part because I have a pcap file in hand). We need to `go get` both
`gopacket` and `gopacket/pcap`.

`go get github.com/google/gopacket/pcap` won't work on Windows. I searched
around and found an [answer on Stack Overflow][stackoverflow-compile-gopacket].
I got it to work with some modification.

Update February 2020: Seems like this is not an issue anymore. Running the `go
get` command above worked for me on Windows 10.

## go get pcap on Windows

1. Install go_amd64 (add go binaries to your PATH). I assume you have a Go environment ready to go.
2. Install [MinGW x64 via Win-Builds][mingw-clone] like I have written about before.
3. Add `C:\mingw\x64\bin` to PATH.
4. Install [npcap][npcap-windows].
5. Download [Winpcap developer's pack][winpcap-devel] and extract it to `C:\`. *So you will have `C:\WpdPack`*.
6. Find `wpcap.dll` and `packet.dll` in `C:\Windows\System32` and copy them somewhere.
7. Run `gendef` (from `MinGW`) on both files.
8. Generate static library files:
    + `dlltool --as-flags=--64 -m i386:x86-64 -k --output-lib libwpcap.a --input-def wpcap.def`
    + `dlltool --as-flags=--64 -m i386:x86-64 -k --output-lib libpacket.a --input-def packet.def`
9. Copy `libwpcap.a` and `libpacket.a` to `c:\WpdPack\Lib\x64`.
10. Finally `go get github.com/google/gopacket/pcap`.

# Reading pcaps
Following the tutorial I started making code snippets to do what I wanted. Most
code is based on the tutorial.

Gopacket godoc and source are also your friends:

- [https://godoc.org/github.com/google/gopacket][gopacket-godoc]
- [https://github.com/google/gopacket][gopacket-github]

## Opening a pcap File
This one shows how to open a pcap file and print the packets.

{{< codecaption title="Opening pcap files - pcap-1.go" lang="go" >}}
// Simple go application that opens a pcap file and print the packets

package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "log"

    "github.com/google/gopacket"
    "github.com/google/gopacket/pcap"
)

var (
    pcapFile string = "capt.pcap"
    handle   *pcap.Handle
    err      error
)

func main() {
    // Open file instead of device
    handle, err = pcap.OpenOffline(pcapFile)
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
    }
    defer handle.Close()

    // Loop through packets in file
    packetSource := gopacket.NewPacketSource(handle, handle.LinkType())
    for packet := range packetSource.Packets() {
        fmt.Println(packet)
    }
}

{{< /codecaption >}}

But I got the following error:

```
$ go run go-pcap-test1.go
2017/12/02 15:48:46 bad dump file format
exit status 1
```

Seems like the original file was in `pcapng` format which is not supported by
`gopacket`. Converting the file to `pcap` worked. The new file is named
`conv.pcap`.

## Setting Filters
Reading everything in the pcap file is good but not what we want. We want to set
a filter and only read certain packets. This can be done with
`handle.SetBPFFilter(filter)` in which `filter` is a string containing a filter
in [BPF syntax][bpf-syntax]. We just pass the filter `icmp`:

{{< codecaption title="Setting filters - pcap-2.go" lang="go" >}}
// How to set a filter and only read certain packets from the pcap file

package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "log"

    "github.com/google/gopacket"
    "github.com/google/gopacket/pcap"
)

var (
    pcapFile string = "conv.pcap"
    handle   *pcap.Handle
    err      error
)

func main() {
    // Open file instead of device
    handle, err = pcap.OpenOffline(pcapFile)
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
    }
    defer handle.Close()

    // Set filter
    var filter string = "icmp"
    err = handle.SetBPFFilter(filter)
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
    }
    fmt.Println("Filter set to ICMP.")

    packetSource := gopacket.NewPacketSource(handle, handle.LinkType())

    for packet := range packetSource.Packets() {
        // Do something with a packet here.
        fmt.Println(packet)
    }
}

{{< /codecaption >}}

This code only reads packets of type `icmp`.

## Layers
`gopacket` is based on layers. You can get each layer from raw packet data
(either from the pcap file or just bytes). Layers are in
`github.com/google/gopacket/layers`. We are interested in IPv4 pings so I used
`ipLayer := packet.Layer(layers.LayerTypeIPv4)`.

Now `ipLayer` is a `*layers.IPv4` (don't worry about it being a pointer) and we
can print it with `fmt.Printf("%+v", ipLayer)` to get:

{{< codecaption title="ipLayer contents" lang="go" >}}
&{BaseLayer:{Contents:[69 0 0 114 185 229 64 0 64 1 29 246 172 16 133 141 172
                       16 133 1]
Payload:[8 0 157 204 16 68 10 36 36 83 84 65 82 84 36 36 83 71 70 116 73 72 78
         111 89 87 53 114 73 72 74 49 98 88 65 115 73 71 53 49 98 71 120 104 73
         71 53 118 98 105 66 104 98 71 78 104 100 72 74 104 73 72 86 48 73 71 82
         108 99 50 86 121 100 87 53 48 73 71 49 112 98 109 108 116 73 71 74 118
         100 87 82 112 10]}
Version:4 IHL:5 TOS:0 Length:114 Id:47589 Flags:DF FragOffset:0 TTL:64
Protocol:ICMPv4 Checksum:7670 SrcIP:172.16.133.141 DstIP:172.16.133.1
Options:[] Padding:[]}
{{< /codecaption >}}

Remember those are printed in decimal (bytes are just uint8 in go) and not hex.
Personally I prefer printing in hex because it's easier for me to read
ASCII-Hex.

### IPv4 Layer
At this point you would think we could just do `ipLayer.Payload` and read it but
we get:

`ipLayer.Payload undefined (type gopacket.Layer has no field or method Payload)`

But if we print the type with `%T` we get `*layers.IPv4` and when we print it
with `%+v` we can see the `Payload` field.

What we have is an interface and the compiler does not know it's going to be
populated by `*layers.IPv4` at runtime. We need to cast the packet to
`*layers.IPv4` manually. Then we can access `Payload`:

{{< codecaption title="Casting ipLayer to ip" lang="go" >}}
ip, _ := ipLayer.(*layers.IPv4)

fmt.Println(ip.Payload)
fmt.Println(len(ip.Payload))
fmt.Println(string(ip.Payload))
{{< /codecaption >}}

Which results in

{{< codecaption title="Contents of ip" lang="go" >}}
[8 0 157 204 16 68 1 0 36 36 83 84 65 82 84 36 36 83 71 70 116 73 72 78 111 89
87 53 114 73 72 74 49 98 88 65 115 73 71 53 49 98 71 120 104 73 71 53 118 98 105
66 104 98 71 78 104 100 72 74 104 73 72 86 48 73 71 82 108 99 50 86 121 100 87
53 48 73 71 49 112 98 109 108 116 73 71 74 118 100 87 82 112 10]

{{< /codecaption >}}

For more info see section [Pointers to Known Layers][gopacket-godoc-pointers] in
gopacket docs.

So we mostly got everything, the payload is some headers and then base64 encoded
data. We could just discard the first 8 (header) + 9 (`$$START$$`) and grab what
we want. But let's do things properly.

## Creating an ICMP Message in Go
We can create an `icmp` message from the IPv4 layer payload.

First we need `go get golang.org/x/net/icmp` and then:

{{< codecaption title="Creating an icmp message from IP payload" lang="go" >}}
const (
    ProtocolICMP     = 1  // Internet Control Message
    ProtocolIPv6ICMP = 58 // ICMP for IPv6
)

...

msg, err := icmp.ParseMessage(ProtocolICMP, ip.Payload)
{{< /codecaption >}}

`ProtocolICMP` and `ProtocolIPv6ICMP` are defined in
`golang.org/x/net/internal/iana`. It's an internal package and we cannot use it
directly. Instead I have copied the constants directly in my code.

The result is [*icmp.Message][icmp-message-godoc]:

{{< codecaption title="icmp.Message struct" lang="go" >}}
type Message struct {
    Type     Type        // type, either ipv4.ICMPType or ipv6.ICMPType
    Code     int         // code
    Checksum int         // checksum
    Body     MessageBody // body
}
{{< /codecaption >}}

We are interested in `Body` of type [MessageBody][messagebody-icmp-godoc] which
is again an interface. If we print the value and type we get:

{{< codecaption title="ip.Body" lang="go" >}}
&{ID:4164 Seq:256
  Data:[36 36 83 84 65 82 84 36 36 83 71 70 116 73 72 78 111 89 87 53 114 73 72
        74 49 98 88 65 115 73 71 53 49 98 71 120 104 73 71 53 118 98 105 66 104
        98 71 78 104 100 72 74 104 73 72 86 48 73 71 82 108 99 50 86 121 100 87
        53 48 73 71 49 112 98 109 108 116 73 71 74 118 100 87 82 112 10]}

*icmp.Echo
{{< /codecaption >}}

### Getting ICMP Payload
But again we need to cast it to `*icmp.Echo` before we can get the `Data` field
which contains the payload.

{{< codecaption title="Casting ip.Body to *icmp.Echo" lang="go" >}}
if body, err := msg.Body.(*icmp.Echo); err {
    // Now we can access Body.Data
    fmt.Println(string(body.Data))
}
{{< /codecaption >}}

Now we have the payload:

`$$START$$SGFtIHNoYW5rIHJ1bXAsIG51bGxhIG5vbiBhbGNhdHJhIHV0IGRlc2VydW50IG1pbmltIGJvdWRp`

This is base64 encoded and we can decode it after removing `$$START$$`:

- `Ham shank rump, nulla non alcatra ut deserunt minim boudi`

The rest is easy. Complete code for this section is in `pcap-3.go`.
