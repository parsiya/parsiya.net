Earlier in December 2020, my `PlayStation Now` report was disclosed. You can see
the report at https://hackerone.com/reports/873614. That is my first paid bounty
and my first disclosed report. It was quite exciting. I doubt I can top it.

## Lesson Learned
I realized that by shunning away from bounties for a few years I lost so many
easy thickclient/desktop vulns. On one hand there are only a dozen desktop
applications in scope but on the other hand they are still untouched.

I still don't think bug bounties can become my only income stream unless I move
to a very cheap country.
