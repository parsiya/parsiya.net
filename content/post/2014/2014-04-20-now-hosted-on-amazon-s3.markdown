title: Now hosted on Amazon S3
---

I moved my blog from Bluehost to Amazon S3. I have not used Cloudfront yet, I doubt my blog has any visitors to justify that.

It was really easy to redirect everything to [cryptogangsta.com](http://www.cryptogangsta.com). [parsiya.net](http://parsiya.net), [www.parsiya.net](http://www.parsiya.net) and [www.cryptogangsta.com](http://www.cryptogangsta.com) should all point to cryptogangsta.com.

I have decided (for n-th time) to start updating this blog. Hopefully I will do it this time, I have some ideas to keep this blog running ;).
