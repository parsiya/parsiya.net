**Update 28 Oct 2017:**\\
I have moved most of my code under one repository. Malware adventure is copied at two places:

- [https://github.com/parsiya/malwareadventure](https://github.com/parsiya/malwareadventure)
- [https://github.com/parsiya/Parsia-Code/tree/master/malware-adventure](https://github.com/parsiya/Parsia-Code/tree/master/malware-adventure)

A fork of PAWS is here:

- [https://github.com/Moonbase59/PAWS](https://github.com/Moonbase59/PAWS)

I finally caved in and started to push some of my code to <del>github</del> bitbucket. It is located at [https://bitbucket.org/parsiya](https://bitbucket.org/parsiya) and is almost empty ;).

This is Malware Adventure. It's a small adventure game I wrote using PAWS. PAWS is Pyhton Adventure Writing System by Roger Plowman. Get it from [http://home.fuse.net/wolfonenet/PAWS.htm](http://home.fuse.net/wolfonenet/PAWS.htm). It's great.

The game itself is a Python program. You define objects which can be be rooms, items etc. You can read more about it in the readme file at [https://bitbucket.org/parsiya/MalwareAdventure](https://bitbucket.org/parsiya/MalwareAdventure).

PS: Yes, I should be working on the Flare-On challenge writeup. It needs more time because I am not only documenting my solution but what other stuff I did. I think failed attempts are as important as the solution in challenge writeups.

PPS: Changed links to `bitbucket` as I stopped using github.
