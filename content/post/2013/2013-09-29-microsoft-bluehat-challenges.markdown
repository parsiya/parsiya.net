title: Microsoft Bluehat Challenges
---

Microsoft has released their Bluehat challenges. You answer the challenge,
 send it out and if correct they will send the next level (at least that is
what they say).

There are three categories: Reverse Engineering, Web and Vulnerabilities.

The first Reverse Engineering challenge was quite easy. But it was level 1
and I do not expect anti-debugging techniques. Let's see about the next level.

Anyway, Enjoy. [Linkie](https://www.microsoft.com/security/msrc/collaboration/bluehatchallenge.aspx).
