I am Parsia, I try to do security most days.

**2024-Present**: Senior Offensive Security Engineer at Microsoft. Despite my
title, I mostly do application security.

**2022-2024**: Sabbatical. Dev contract work for a static analysis tool that
automatically generates an OpenAPI spec from the backend source code. Some
security research, mainly static analysis and Rust. See
[Personal Semgrep Server in Rust][sem-server],
[semgrep-rs: Rust crate to interact with Semgrep][semgrep-rs], and
[some tree-sitter stuff][tree-sitter].

**Who is Hackerman?**

*Hackerman* is a character from the movie [Kung Fury][kungfury-youtube]. He is
the greatest hacker of all time and can hack people through time. He also hacks
with a Nintendo Power Glove like me.

**What is This Website?**

This website is my security research and notes. It doubles as my cheat sheet and
knowledge base along with [parsiya.io](https://parsiya.io). I look up pages or
send links to this website at least a few times every day. It's part of my
brand. You don't wanna be the other guy from Wham!

**What does "Don't be The Other Guy from Wham!" Mean?**

[Wham!][wham-link] was a popular UK music duo. Most people remember one of its
members, George Michael. No one remembers the other guy,
[Andrew Ridgeley][andrew-link]. Write a blog, don't be afraid to promote
yourself (if you have the time). It's worth it.
