I am Parsia, a Security Engineer, part of the Game and Platform Security
Engineering group at [Electronic Arts](https://www.ea.com/security).
[Realistic video of me hacking videogames at work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRWvfMLl4ho).

From 2013 to 2019, I was a Senior Security Consultant at
[Synopsys Software Integrity Group](https://www.synopsys.com/software-integrity.html)
through the 2016 Cigital acquisition based out of the Washington DC area in the
United States. I tested enterprise blockchains, online multiplayer games, stock
exchange platforms, mobile device management suites, network appliances,
embedded and IoT devices on top of a long list of thickclient/mobile/web
applications we all use on a daily basis.

I have had **one** single talk. That was at DEF CON 26. I guess I should add
`DEF CON Speaker` to my LinkedIn title (lol):

**Who is Hackerman?**\\
*Hackerman* is a character from the movie
[Kung Fury](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bS5P_LAqiVg). He is the greatest
hacker of all time and can hack people through time. He also has a
[hacking tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEkrWRHCDQU).

**What is this website?**\\
This website is my security research and notes. It doubles as my cheat sheet and
knowledge base along with [parsiya.io](http://parsiya.io). I look up pages or
send links to this website at least a few times every day. It's part of my
brand. You don't wanna be the other guy from Wham!

**What does "don't be the other guy from Wham!" mean?**\\
[Wham!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wham!) was a popular UK music duo. Most
people remember one of its members, George Michael. No one remembers the other
guy, [Andrew Ridgeley](https://www.google.com/search?q=andrew+ridgeley). Write a
blog, don't be afraid to promote yourself. It's worth it.

**Goals in progress:**

- Using Go in security tooling. I have replaced Python with Go in my workflow.
    - https://github.com/parsiya/Hacking-with-Go
    - https://github.com/parsiya/Go-Security
    - https://github.com/parsiya/Parsia-Code
    - [https://parsiya.net/categories/go/]({{< relref "categories/go" >}} "https://parsiya.net/categories/go/") 
- In-memory fuzzing via binary instrumentation (aka traversing arbitrary
  assembly blobs over and over and over).
    - [https://parsiya.net/categories/winappdbg/]({{< relref "categories/winappdbg" >}} "https://parsiya.net/categories/winappdbg/") 
- Automation:
