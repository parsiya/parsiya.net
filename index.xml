WebSocket WebSocket connection to communicate with the &lt;code>Remote WSL&lt;/code> extension.
JavaScript in websites can connect to this server and execute arbitrary commands
on the target system. Assigned &lt;a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/vulnerability/CVE-2021-43907" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CVE-2021-43907&lt;/a> and zero bounty. I paid 5
USD for the EC2 machine hosting the proof-of-concept.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It's really funny that PlayStation paid 15K USD for &lt;a href="https://hackerone.com/reports/873614" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">almost the same bug&lt;/a>
with 2.2 million subscribers (it was out of scope in their program, too), but
MSFT doesn't pay for an official extension with more than 10 million installs
(obviously, not every install is unique) for one of their most popular products.
But you are not here to listen to my rants. So, read on.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This post's target audience was &lt;code>Desktop Application Security People&lt;/code> niche. I
want to clarify some issues because more people have read it (edit on 2021-12-21):&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>I didn't get 5 dollars. I paid 5 dollars out of pocket, so it's -5.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&amp;quot;I am not angry, I am just disappointed.&amp;quot; I knew it was out-of-scope. This
wasn't some bait-and-switch by Microsoft. I am not angry&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The vuln is &lt;strong>not&lt;/strong> in VS Code. MSFT says it's in the &lt;code>Remote WSL&lt;/code> extension
but I think it's in the way &lt;code>VS Code Server&lt;/code> works with the remote
development extensions.&lt;/li>

loading remote files, reversing a custom scripting engine to instrument the

Burp extension. It's a Burp extension that aims to mimic Burp issues for the
community (free) version. For reasons, I decided to rewrite it in Java. This is
the first part of my series on what I learned switching to Java.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This part discusses how my environment is set up for development with
&lt;a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Visual Studio Code&lt;/a>. Things like
auto-completion, Gradle builds and most importantly debugging.&lt;/p>

clone the following repository:&lt;/p>

the Microsoft
&lt;a href="https://github.com/microsoft/AttackSurfaceAnalyzer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AttackSurfaceAnalyzer&lt;/a> (ASA
moving forward) GUI version.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>ASA uses &lt;a href="https://github.com/ElectronNET/Electron.NET" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Electron.NET&lt;/a> which
binds the internal Kestrel web server to &lt;code>0.0.0.0&lt;/code>. If permission is given to
bypass the Windows OS firewall (or if used on an OS without one), a remote
attacker can connect to it and access the application.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The web application is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). A remote
attacker can submit a runID with embedded JavaScript that is executed by
the victim using the ASA Electron application.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Electron.NET does not have the &lt;code>NodeIntegration&lt;/code> flag set to false. This
allows the JavaScript payload to spawn up processes on the victim's machine.&lt;/li>

&lt;li>Take a snapshot of the cache.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Run the application and use different functionalities.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Take another snapshot of the cache.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Compare these two snapshots.&lt;/li>

&lt;p>It has some grinding. At each dungeon level (there are four), you have grind the items needed for crafting the next level equipment. After farming for multiple hours to get a few drops of one item, I decided to cheat at it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This post talks about how I discovered the save file and how we can modify it to give ourselves any item in the game.

I have used similar extensions when testing mobile and thickclient applications.&lt;/p>

&lt;li>Set a session handling rule to do one of the two:
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Update the cookie from the cookie jar. In this case you login as user2 first and let Burp update cookies.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Run a macro to create a valid session for user2 and use the token.&lt;/li>

This post documents what I have learned about them and how they can be converted to a Golang &lt;a href="https://golang.org/pkg/time/#Time" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">time.Time&lt;/a> and then converted to any desirable format after that.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We will start by looking at endian-ness and use a real-world example to practice our newly acquired knowledge.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>TL;DR: To convert a Windows Filetime to Go's time.Time:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Read 8 bytes in LittleEndian from the file.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Create a &lt;code>syscall.Filetime&lt;/code>.
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Assign the first 4 bytes to &lt;code>LowDateTime&lt;/code> field and the other four to &lt;code>HighDateTime&lt;/code>.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Convert the resulting Filetime to nanoseconds with &lt;a href="https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/sys/windows#Filetime.Nanoseconds" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Filetime.Nanoseconds()&lt;/a>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Convert the resulting value to &lt;a href="https://golang.org/pkg/time/#Time" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">time.Time&lt;/a>.&lt;/li>

In short, I write most of my notes in markdown so I wanted to grab them and store them in a specific format with annotations (e.g. everything under heading &lt;code>deployment notes&lt;/code> is labeled as such in the final data file). These are not high volume, large files. I have written them manually, I am talking about a 10-20 KB file (with most content being pasted code/request snippets). I am not looking for efficiency.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://godoc.org/gopkg.in/russross/blackfriday.v2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Blackfriday&lt;/a> is the markdown parser for &lt;a href="https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hugo&lt;/a>, so I was somewhat familiar with it.

&lt;p>In this post, I am going to describe what I learned during the process and how I leveraged Blackfriday's markdown parser in some hacky ways to get annotated data.

However, I have not done more than a few practical examples that I can show my co-workers or anyone else asking questions. Recently, I came across the Damn Vulnerable Thick Client Application by SecVulture at &lt;a href="https://github.com/secvulture/dvta" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://github.com/secvulture/dvta&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I am not going to use the original version of the application. Someone has created a fork and added more protections. We will use this fork instead:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://github.com/nddmars/dvta" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://github.com/nddmars/dvta&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Neither fork's setup instructions worked for me. As a result, the first part is actually setting up the application and the necessary back-end in only one VM. But don't worry, we will do a bit of reverse engineering with dnSpy to fix an issue.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Thanks to SecVulture for creating the app and maintainers of the second repository for adding protections.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Istanbul Tips and Tricks</title><link>https://parsiya.net/blog/2018-07-04-istanbul-tips-and-tricks/</link><pubDate>Wed, 04 Jul 2018 05:56:48 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://parsiya.net/blog/2018-07-04-istanbul-tips-and-tricks/</guid><description>&lt;p>Recently I was in Istanbul for two weeks in June 2018.

If you have a Go package that parses some input, you might be able fuzz it with Go-Fuzz (terms and conditions apply). Not everything can be fuzzed very easily. For example Go-Fuzz does not like cycling imports, so if one of your sub-packages imports the main package then you are in trouble (I am looking at your &lt;a href="https://github.com/alecthomas/chroma" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chroma&lt;/a>).&lt;/p>

&lt;/h1>&lt;p>Instead of creating an index manually for Github, I am using a Hugo blog for my knowledge base (a.k.a. &lt;code>Parsia-Clone&lt;/code>). This blog is about my flow and how I have semi-automated the process. Demo site is at &lt;a href="https://parsiya.io" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://parsiya.io&lt;/a> (it's served in plaintext because I am making rapid changes and do not want to invalidate CloudFront's cache after every push).&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="flow">Flow
&lt;a class="header-link" href="#flow">&lt;svg class="fill-current o-60 hover-accent-color-light" height="22px" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="22px" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">&lt;path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/>&lt;path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76 0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71 0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71 0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76 0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/>&lt;/svg>&lt;/a>
&lt;/h1>&lt;p>Flow is pretty simple:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Create the page bundle directory and page in the clone with &lt;code>hugo new&lt;/code>. I usually create it under &lt;code>categories\main-category-name&lt;/code>. The command will look like:
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;code>hugo new categories\research\hacking-the-gibson\index.md&lt;/code>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Run &lt;code>hugo serve&lt;/code> to preview the page during the edit.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Fill front matter and write the page in &lt;code>index.md&lt;/code>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Any resources such as pictures and files can be in the same directory. This helps in two ways, they can be referenced in the page (like pictures) and seen on Github (like config files).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When done, &lt;code>git add/commit/push&lt;/code> the clone inside the &lt;code>content&lt;/code> directory.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>???&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Profit. See updated blog, built and deployed by &lt;code>Travis CI&lt;/code>.&lt;/li>

Not having done this before, I encountered some pitfalls. Additionally I had two extra problems:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The structure of the blog is different from most Hugo deployments. &lt;a href="https://github.com/parsiya/Parsia-Clone" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Parsia-Clone&lt;/a> only contains the &lt;code>content&lt;/code> directory. Parents and everything else are in the &lt;a href="https://github.com/parsiya/Parsiya.io" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">parsiya.io&lt;/a> repo. So while we push to &lt;code>Parsia-Clone&lt;/code>, we need to clone &lt;code>parsiya.io&lt;/code> and build the repository there.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I am hosting it out of an S3 bucket. All other examples were using github pages.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Update November 2020:&lt;/strong> As of late November 2020, I have switched to Github
actions for both &lt;code>parsiya.net&lt;/code> and &lt;code>parsiya.io&lt;/code>. Please see
&lt;a href="https://github.com/parsiya/Parsia-Clone/blob/main/.github/workflows/deploy.ymlOLD" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">deploy.ymlOLD&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Update February 2021:&lt;/strong> parsiya.io is now hosted on github pages with a custom
domain instead of an S3 bucket. Please see the workflow file at

Currently, this version is not used in Hugo.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Hugo has switched to &lt;a href="https://github.com/alecthomas/chroma" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chroma&lt;/a> for syntax highlighting from Pygments. While it still supports Pygments, it appears Chroma is much faster. However, Chroma does not support the &lt;a href="https://github.com/john2x/solarized-pygment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">solarized dark&lt;/a> theme that is used by &lt;a href="https://github.com/parsiya/Hugo-Octopress" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hugo-Octopress&lt;/a>. So I had to generate the CSS and add it manually.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The process is decently simple because Chroma has a &lt;a href="https://github.com/alecthomas/chroma#styles" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">built-in tool for converting styles&lt;/a> &lt;code>_tools/style.py&lt;/code>. You can see the files inside my clone:&lt;/p>

Like any other model, blockchains attempt to solve a few problems and as a result introduce some challenges. &lt;strong>Byzantine Fault Tolerance&lt;/strong> or &lt;strong>BFT&lt;/strong> is one of those buzzwords that go around during nowadays. Blockchains have consensus models that claim to achieve BFT.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here are my notes on BFT and how it relates to blockchains. I do not claim these notes to be neither complete nor correct. I am still learning. This is not an academic paper. I am just writing down what worked for me in hopes of helping others.

&lt;p>In this post I will talk about parts of the live state file format and show some data that can be extracted from these files. The format is not formally documented but we have access to commented source.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To make it easier, I have uploaded the live state from our previous MysteryVM separately.

&lt;/h3>&lt;p>&lt;strong>Problem&lt;/strong>: We have an encrypted Virtual Machine (VM) disk and the associated
VirtualBox (VBox) live snapshot (taken when user was logged in). Mount the VM
and restore the live snapshot to get access to the data.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It seems pretty easy, but turns out it's not and looks to be a first of its kind
tutorial (at least public). This is surprising because I can imagine this issue
being a recurring problem in the forensics community.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A few days ago I did a couple of Forensics challenges. Both involved mounting
images and analyzing the contents of a VM. The second challenge was a disk and a
live snapshot. Part of the challenge involved mounting the snapshot and
restoring the state to log in.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It's an ongoing challenge so I do not want to spill the beans. Instead, I have
re-created a VM to show what I did. Hopefully this will help the next person
with a similar problem.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Decoding Large Base64 Files with Go</title><link>https://parsiya.net/blog/2018-01-19-decoding-large-base64-files-with-go/</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 Jan 2018 22:45:55 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://parsiya.net/blog/2018-01-19-decoding-large-base64-files-with-go/</guid><description>&lt;p>I am working on this challenge and it has a large base64 file.

As usual, the tool turned out to be much larger than I thought.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I realized I cannot find any examples of SSH certificate verification. There are a few examples for host keys here and there. Even the &lt;code>certs_test.go&lt;/code> file just checks the host name. There was a &lt;a href="https://github.com/golang/go/issues/23266" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">typo in an error message&lt;/a>&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> in the &lt;code>crypto/ssh&lt;/code> package but I think because this is not very much used, had gone unreported.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here's my step by step guide to writing this tool by piggybacking on SSH host verification callbacks. Hopefully this will make it easier for the next person.&lt;/p>

I still have a couple of copies around for testing. Unfortunately after XP going out of support, they were removed. But the copies used to be on &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskNetsec/comments/6qea8a/need_a_windows_xp_iso/dkwq0qw/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Azure CDN&lt;/a> (credit &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/JoshBrodieNZ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">/u/JoshBrodieNZ&lt;/a>. Seems like they recently removed them too.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There's still a way to get Windows XP 32-bit VMs from Microsoft (no 64-bit) through Windows XP mode. It contains a VHD (virtual hard disk) with a 32-bit Windows XP SP3.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>EDIT 2022-01-12&lt;/strong>: The link below is dead. Looks like Windows XP Mode was tied to Windows 7 and removed when it went EOL.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Download Microsoft XP Mode from &lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=8002" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=8002&lt;/a>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Using 7-zip or any other utility decompress the exe.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Inside sources, there's another file called &lt;code>xpm&lt;/code>. Decompress it too. With 7-zip, right click on it and select &amp;quot;Extract to ... .&amp;quot;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>One of the extracted files is &lt;code>VirtualXPVHD&lt;/code> and around 1.2 GB. Rename it to &lt;code>VirtualXP.vhd&lt;/code>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In VirtualBox (or any other virtualization software that supports importing VHDs), create a new Windows XP 32-bit VM and use this file as the hard disk. When you start the VM, it will start a Windows XP setup. My mouse did not work, but you can use shortcut keys to navigate the installer (e.g. Alt+N for Next).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>???&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Profit.&lt;/li>

&lt;p>We have learned some good stuff. In this part I am going to talk about the original problem that led me to learning WinAppDbg. This is my writeup for challenge 3 &amp;quot;Greek to me&amp;quot; of &lt;a href="https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2017/10/2017-flare-on-challenge-solutions.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FlareOn 2017&lt;/a>. This is a bruteforce challenge and is rather easy but instead of bruteforcing it the conventional (and straightforward way), I will show how I traversed arbitrary Assembly blobs using WinAppDbg.&lt;/p>

In this part we are going to learn a few new things:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>I wrote a &lt;a href="https://github.com/parsiya/WinAppUtil" title="WinAppDbg repository on Github" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">simple python module&lt;/a> to simplify my use of WinAppDbg. It will most likely be modified later, but I have included a version that works with the tutorials at:
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://github.com/parsiya/Parsia-Code/tree/master/winappdbg" title="WinAppDbg code in Parsia-Code" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://github.com/parsiya/Parsia-Code/tree/master/winappdbg&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We do not need to type the full filename anymore if the executable is in PATH. Note Run Line (&lt;code>win+r&lt;/code>) pulls stuff from more locations than PATH, so we cannot call &lt;code>chrome.exe&lt;/code>. I have written about it &lt;a href="https://parsiya.net/blog/2017-10-23-run-line-vs.-cmd-vs.-powershell/" title="Run Line vs. cmd vs. PowerShell">here&lt;/a>.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>DLL enumeration&lt;/strong>: We're going to implement one of procmon's features.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Process/Thread tracing&lt;/strong>: Another procmon feature.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Function Hooking&lt;/strong>: It's very easy in WinAppDbg and we will learn how to do it a couple of different ways.
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>We will hook pre-TLS encryption data for Internet Explorer and Firefox to hack the Gibson.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>Proxy settings are usually configured per user and are not applicable to Windows services.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you have to proxy a Windows service, here are some of the things you can try (and hope they work).&lt;/p>

It's an XML
file named &lt;code>appName.exe.config&lt;/code>. We can pass a proxy address in this file.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These apps usually use WinINET or IE proxy settings. Sometimes, they do not. We
can either use an application specific config file or use one for the entire
.NET framework for a machine.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Look inside the decompiled code (or just grep the binary files) for references
to &lt;code>System.Configuration&lt;/code> &lt;a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.configuration.configuration%28v=vs.110%29.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MSDN-page&lt;/a>. Applications

I did not find such a resource online that looked at proxies from an infosec perspective. Most talked about how to configure caching or forwarding proxies and not much about MitM ones. I have briefly talked about it in the section 2 of the same post named &lt;code>How does a Proxy Work?&lt;/code>. In this post I am going to take a deep(er) dive.

&lt;p>Portproxy allows you to listen on a certain port on one of your network

Now I will talk about proxying actual applications. I will start with something easy, the &lt;a href="http://filehippo.com/download_app_manager/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FileHippo App Manager&lt;/a>. This app was chosen because it can be proxied with Burp, it does not use TLS and it has its own proxy settings (also works with Internet Explorer proxy settings). The requests are pretty simple to understand. I like the FileHippo website because it archives old versions of software. For example I loved the non-bloated Yahoo! Messenger 8.0 when I used it (it's pretty popular in some places) and used FileHippo to download the old versions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>FileHippo App Manager turned out to be more interesting than I thought and this post turned into some .NET reverse engineering using dnSpy. Here's what I talk about in this post:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The app contains the AWS SDK and a fortunately invalid set of AWS Access/Secret keys. Both the SDK and the keys are in dead code.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Requests have an &lt;code>AccessToken&lt;/code> header which is generated client-side. We will discuss how it is generated.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The application has a &amp;quot;hidden&amp;quot; DEBUG mode which unfortunately does nothing special. We will discover how to enable it.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul></description></item><item><title>Looking for Apps to Proxy</title><link>https://parsiya.net/blog/2016-05-09-looking-for-apps-to-proxy/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 May 2016 01:37:41 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://parsiya.net/blog/2016-05-09-looking-for-apps-to-proxy/</guid><description>&lt;p>It's been a while since Burp part four and I want to continue writing these. It's time to actually proxy applications. However I have three problems:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>I was too busy at work.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I could not find a lot of interesting applications that are interesting to proxy and can showcase different Burp functionalities that we talked about.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I found some interesting applications but there were security vulns so I am going through disclosure (unfortunately I may never be able to release them publicly).&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>The last point was a surprise, these are decently popular apps and I could not believe that no one has looked at them before.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Nevertheless, I will continue soon.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the meanwhile, Burp version &lt;code>1.7&lt;/code> has been &lt;a href="http://releases.portswigger.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released&lt;/a>. Now we have Burp projects. Instead of saving the state everyday, we can use one project file that contains all the items. Pretty cool. Some of the items have changed, especially options. Now it has &lt;code>User Options&lt;/code> and &lt;code>Project Options&lt;/code> but the options by themselves are still there.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Cloudfront and TLS</title><link>https://parsiya.net/blog/2016-04-14-cloudfront-and-tls/</link><pubDate>Thu, 14 Apr 2016 20:45:15 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://parsiya.net/blog/2016-04-14-cloudfront-and-tls/</guid><description>&lt;p>I finally decided to cave in and take advantage of the Amazon Cloudfront free TLS certificate. I know I will end up paying more than what I already do but I pay few bucks each month. Each month I pay one dollar for two hosted zones and another dollar or so for the bandwidth. Even if I was still in my home country, I would have been able to pay this as it is less than a large pizza even where I lived.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you are interested in free hosting alternatives, you can use &lt;a href="https://gohugo.io/tutorials/github-pages-blog/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Github-pages&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://gohugo.io/tutorials/hosting-on-bitbucket/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bitbucket&lt;/a> or just go with the excellent &lt;a href="https://gitlab.com/pages/hugo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gitlab-Pages&lt;/a> (which supports Hugo and whole lot of other static website generators natively).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It took me a lot of tries and probably burning a good amount of money on Cloudfront invalidation requests (otherwise I had to wait for a day or so to see the changes) but it finally worked. The trick was to setup the origin policy during creation of the distribution as it cannot be modified through the web portal after that.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Burp part five is still on hold for now because I am doing something else.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Thick Client Proxying - Part 4: Burp in Proxy Chains</title><link>https://parsiya.net/blog/2016-04-07-thick-client-proxying-part-4-burp-in-proxy-chains/</link><pubDate>Thu, 07 Apr 2016 21:17:25 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://parsiya.net/blog/2016-04-07-thick-client-proxying-part-4-burp-in-proxy-chains/</guid><description>&lt;p>In this post I will talk about using Burp as part of a proxy chain. The number of applications that can be proxied by Burp and used with Burp in proxy chains is &lt;em>infinite&lt;/em> for documentation purposes. Instead I am going to demonstrate how to use some of more used tools with Burp in proxy chain. All of this is going to happen on a Windows 7 Virtual Machine (VM).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These applications/utilities are:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://www.cygwin.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cygwin&lt;/a>: I will use cURL commands for demonstration purposes.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>IBM Appscan Standard: I will use the evaluation version.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://www.charlesproxy.com/download/latest-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Charles Proxy&lt;/a>: For when you have to use multiple proxies.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://www.telerik.com/download/fiddler" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fiddler&lt;/a>: Same as above.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://www.soapui.org/downloads/soapui.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SoapUI&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>You don't need Burp Pro to play along and apart from Appscan, all application are free to use. For Appscan we will use the evaluation version which is free for its demo test.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Hugo Octopress Update</title><link>https://parsiya.net/blog/2016-04-03-hugo-octopress-update/</link><pubDate>Sun, 03 Apr 2016 13:13:39 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://parsiya.net/blog/2016-04-03-hugo-octopress-update/</guid><description>&lt;p>I have made a good number of changes to the &lt;a href="https://github.com/parsiya/hugo-octopress" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hugo-Octopress&lt;/a> theme.

&lt;p>Apart from Bugs, I had hardcoded too many settings in the theme. For example, modifying the text in the sidebar could only be accomplished by changing the sidebar template. Ideally user should not need to modify anything in the theme and it should be customizable by just using the config file.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the end I created a bunch of issues on Github and then closed them myself.

I usually use it during mobile and thick client tests. If the application is using HTTP methods then Burp is your best friend.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I am going to document a bunch of Burp tips and tricks that have helped me during my work. One purpose is to share it with the world and not be the other guy from Wham! (:D) and the other is to have it in an accessible place (similar to the cheat sheet in the menu).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This part one I talk about Interception and Proxy listeners which are configured via &lt;code>Proxy &amp;gt; Options&lt;/code>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At the time of writing the current version of Burp Pro is &lt;code>1.6.39&lt;/code> and most items should apply to the current Burp Free version (&lt;code>1.6.32&lt;/code>). Most settings have not changed since I started working with Burp (v1.5). You can download Burp from: &lt;a href="https://portswigger.net/burp/download.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://portswigger.net/burp/download.html&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When I started this, I did not think I have so much stuff to write about Burp. So I broke it into multiple parts. Please note that these series of posts are not targeted towards web application testing so I have skipped some functionalities. If you have any favorite tips or usecases and want them included with credit please let me know, as usual feedback is always welcome.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Cheat Sheet</title><link>https://parsiya.net/cheatsheet/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Feb 2016 22:29:57 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://parsiya.net/cheatsheet/</guid><description>You will find those commands and tips that I need from time to time (and usually forget when I need them).

&lt;p>Burp uses custom certificates to Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) the traffic. All of these certificates are signed by Burp's root Certificate Authority (CA). Each installation of Burp generates its own root CA that needs to be installed in the browser or Operating System's certificate store to be recognized properly. Otherwise browsers will return warnings and some thick client applications will not recognize these certificates as valid.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Each installation of Burp generates its own root CA so it is unlikely that others can gain access to it and sign certificates to MitM your connection. To get the certificate's private key, the attackers need to get to your local machine and if so they have better ways to look at your traffic anyway.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>Note&lt;/strong>: These instructions are for Burp version 1.6.37 Pro and 1.6.32 Free. As long as I remember (v1.5) these instructions have not changed, although they may change in the future but I really doubt it.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Archive Page in Hugo</title><link>https://parsiya.net/blog/2016-02-14-archive-page-in-hugo/</link><pubDate>Sun, 14 Feb 2016 20:52:45 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://parsiya.net/blog/2016-02-14-archive-page-in-hugo/</guid><description>&lt;p>This is a re-hash of my answer on Hugo forums about creating a custom archive page.

This has been quite the adventure. In &lt;a href="https://parsiya.net/blog/2015-10-08-proxying-hipchat-part-1-where-did-the-traffic-go/" title="Proxying Hipchat Part 1: Where did the Traffic Go?">&lt;strong>part1&lt;/strong>&lt;/a> we identified the endpoints. In &lt;a href="https://parsiya.net/blog/2015-10-09-proxying-hipchat-part-2-so-you-think-you-can-use-burp/" title="Proxying Hipchat Part 2: So You Think You Can Use Burp?">&lt;strong>part2&lt;/strong>&lt;/a> we answered the question “So you think you can use Burp” with yes and proxied some of Hipchat's traffic with Burp.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this part we will talk about developing our own proxy in Python to view Hipchat's traffic to/form &lt;code>hipchatserver.com&lt;/code> (our example Hipchat server). First we are going to discuss how proxies work and we will get over Burp breaking our heart by creating our own proxy in Python to observe and dump the traffic in plaintext.&lt;/p>

Because it uses a known protocol (XMPP) and I thought it's an interesting application.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I used Hipchat Windows client version 2. At the time of writing version 4 is in beta.

Most of our work is on
&lt;code>consumer applications&lt;/code> where &lt;code>consumer&lt;/code> means either the customer or an
employee of our client. But these applications usually have network
communications.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When looking at thick client applications from a network traffic perspective, we
face two big challenges:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Traffic Attribution&lt;/strong> or &lt;strong>Where does this traffic come from?&lt;/strong>: How to we
identify application's traffic? The operating system (in this case Windows)
is running many applications and services. Each of them may have network
connectivity.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Proxying Traffic&lt;/strong> or &lt;strong>How do I look view/modify traffic?&lt;/strong>: This is more
challenging and involves capturing, modifying and in a lot of cases
decrypting/decoding target application's traffic. This could be as easy as
setting up Burp via an application setting (EZ-mode) or as hard as setting up
your own access point to capture a device's traffic then developing your own
decryption plugin for your proxy tool (good luck).&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>In this post, I will be talking about the much easier first challenge. I will be
talking about some of the tools and techniques that I use to accomplish this.
This is not a groundbreaking post ;). We will use a simple application, in this
case &lt;code>notepad++&lt;/code>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Image Popup and Octopress</title><link>https://parsiya.net/blog/2015-07-26-image-popup-and-octopress/</link><pubDate>Sun, 26 Jul 2015 23:02:58 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://parsiya.net/blog/2015-07-26-image-popup-and-octopress/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;strong>Update&lt;/strong>: I have migrated the blog to &lt;a href="https://gohugo.io" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hugo&lt;/a> and I do not use this anymore.

&lt;p>I finally realized that I need an image popup plugin. The image plugins that I usually use do not support this. They are fine for normal images but not for larger ones.

Unfortunately I cannot talk about it, so I decided to put the first part out. If I find an opensource program similar to the assessment I will try and recreate the tool (but I am not holding my breath). As this part is essentially a build up, it may not be coherent at times. Alteratively, if you really want to read it, you can join us. We are almost always hiring (let me do the referral though ;).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Today we are going to talk about discovering encryption keys in sneaky ways. We will start with simple examples, do a bit of Digital Forensics or DF (for low standards of DF) and finally in part two we will use our recently acquired knowledge of Pintool to do &lt;code>[redacted]&lt;/code>.&lt;/p>

This makes sense because not all ciphers use IV and not all AES modes of operation (e.</description></item><item><title>Piping SSL/TLS Traffic from SoapUI to Burp</title><link>https://parsiya.net/blog/2014-06-25-piping-ssl/tls-traffic-from-soapui-to-burp/</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 Jun 2014 22:04:53 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://parsiya.net/blog/2014-06-25-piping-ssl/tls-traffic-from-soapui-to-burp/</guid><description>Recently I was trying to test a web service. The traffic was over SSL/TLS and everything was fine. As I am better with Burp than SoapUI, I wanted to use Burp as a proxy for SoapUI. This should be an easy matter. Burp will create a custom certificate (signed by its root CA) for each site and effectively Man-in-the-Middle the connection. But this time it was different, I was getting the dreaded Peer not Authenticated error.</description></item><item><title>Pasting Shellcode in GDB using Python</title><link>https://parsiya.net/blog/2014-05-25-pasting-shellcode-in-gdb-using-python/</link><pubDate>Sun, 25 May 2014 18:39:58 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://parsiya.net/blog/2014-05-25-pasting-shellcode-in-gdb-using-python/</guid><description>A few days ago I was trying to write an exploit for a buffer overflow with GDB. This was a console application and pasting shellcode would mess with it.
There are a few options:
Writing shellcode to a file and then using it as input for GDB. # you can also include GDB commands like setting up breakpoints (e.g. b * 0xDEADBEEF) # remember to include a new line after each command $ python -c &amp;#39;print &amp;#34;b * 0xDEADBEEF&amp;#34; + &amp;#34;\n&amp;#34; + &amp;#34;\x41&amp;#34;*1000 + &amp;#34;\n&amp;#34;&amp;#39; &amp;gt; input # $ perl -e for perl # start debugging with GDB # -q (quiet mode): no text at startup $ gdb executable1 -q (gdb) run &amp;lt; input After this you can manually debug in GDB.</description></item><item><title>Amazon S3 and CSS</title><link>https://parsiya.net/blog/2014-04-22-amazon-s3-and-css/</link><pubDate>Tue, 22 Apr 2014 14:03:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://parsiya.net/blog/2014-04-22-amazon-s3-and-css/</guid><description>After I deployed my blog to Amazon S3, I realized that there was no CSS applied to the pages. In Octopress, the look and feel of website is managed by stylesheets/screen.css. It was fine in rake preview but not on the S3 bucket. I looked around for a few hours to no avail. There was one other person who had the same issue on [stackoverflow] stackoverflowlink but no answers.

I have not used Cloudfront yet, I doubt my blog has any visitors to justify that.
It was really easy to redirect everything to cryptogangsta.com. parsiya.net, www.parsiya.net and www.cryptogangsta.com should all point to cryptogangsta.com.
I have decided (for n-th time) to start updating this blog. Hopefully I will do it this time, I have some ideas to keep this blog running ;).</description></item><item><title>How do I TLS Ciphersuite?</title><link>https://parsiya.net/blog/2013-11-17-how-do-i-tls-ciphersuite/</link><pubDate>Sun, 17 Nov 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://parsiya.net/blog/2013-11-17-how-do-i-tls-ciphersuite/</guid><description>&lt;p>“Should we use RC4 or AES-CBC ?”
This is a legitimate question. Many have heard of the highly publicized attacks against AES-CBC (CRIME, BEAST etc) and lean towards RC4.
If asked (granted no one asks me), my answer would be: If you can control web servers (not feasible in all situations) and users' browsers
(almost impossible), upgrade to TLS 1.2 and go with AES-GCM. However, not many browsers supported these and to be honest, more users trumps loss
of security in many cases.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Microsoft Bluehat Challenges</title><link>https://parsiya.net/blog/2013-09-29-microsoft-bluehat-challenges/</link><pubDate>Sun, 29 Sep 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://parsiya.net/blog/2013-09-29-microsoft-bluehat-challenges/</guid><description>Microsoft has released their Bluehat challenges. You answer the challenge, send it out and if correct they will send the next level (at least that is what they say).
There are three categories: Reverse Engineering, Web and Vulnerabilities.
The first Reverse Engineering challenge was quite easy. But it was level 1 and I do not expect anti-debugging techniques. Let's see about the next level.
Anyway, Enjoy.

The concept of linguistic malware was interesting and ahead of its time. I noticed that the term &amp;quot;Virus&amp;quot; was used correctly in the book as the malware was not propagating between people (then it would become a worm). Although I suspect it was due to the fact that most people (read almost everyone) calls any malware a &amp;quot;virus&amp;quot;. Nevertheless, it was a very enjoyable read.</description></item><item><title>Update Inc</title><link>https://parsiya.net/blog/2013-09-20-update-inc/</link><pubDate>Fri, 20 Sep 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://parsiya.net/blog/2013-09-20-update-inc/</guid><description>So, I transferred my domain from my last provider, it has not taken effect yet.

Although compared to writing LaTeX source, it is a breeze. During my last year at JHU I started writing the reports and what not directly into LaTeX, I think using MarkDown for blogging and MS Office at work is going to take away my old skills.
On a side note, I am now up to around 500 million cookies per second (CpS) in Cookie Clicker.</description></item><item><title>Hello Octopress</title><link>https://parsiya.net/blog/2013-09-14-hello-octopress/</link><pubDate>Sat, 14 Sep 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://parsiya.net/blog/2013-09-14-hello-octopress/</guid><description>** Octopress is here **
To be honest setting it up took a while (I had this feeling that I should set it up on my host but well let's say I am a n00b and am allowed to make mistakes) :D
Now I have to learn markdown which is probably a good thing, unless I can write blog posts in different formats. Note to self: search to see if we can write blogs in LaTeX.</description></item><item><title>Who is this guy?</title><link>https://parsiya.net/about/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2013 21:40:56 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://parsiya.net/about/</guid><description>I am Parsia, a Senior Security Engineer at Electronic Arts.
