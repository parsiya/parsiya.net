However, it is still in the repository.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I finally realized that I need an image popup plugin. The image plugins that I usually use do not support this. They are fine for normal images but not for larger ones. When I see a screenshot of a tool, I want to be able to zoom in. In my quest I looked at a few plugins and methods and finally decided to use &lt;a href="https://github.com/ctdk/octopress-image-popup" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://github.com/ctdk/octopress-image-popup&lt;/a>. It creates resized thumbnails automatically and the installation procedure is short and simple.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, it did not work for me out of the box. I created a test post with just an image and while the plugin worked, there are things that I did not like about it.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Update Inc</title><link>https://parsiya.net/blog/2013-09-20-update-inc/</link><pubDate>Fri, 20 Sep 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://parsiya.net/blog/2013-09-20-update-inc/</guid><description>So, I transferred my domain from my last provider, it has not taken effect yet.

Although compared to writing LaTeX source, it is a breeze. During my last year at JHU I started writing the reports and what not directly into LaTeX, I think using MarkDown for blogging and MS Office at work is going to take away my old skills.
On a side note, I am now up to around 500 million cookies per second (CpS) in Cookie Clicker.</description></item><item><title>Hello Octopress</title><link>https://parsiya.net/blog/2013-09-14-hello-octopress/</link><pubDate>Sat, 14 Sep 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://parsiya.net/blog/2013-09-14-hello-octopress/</guid><description>** Octopress is here **
To be honest setting it up took a while (I had this feeling that I should set it up on my host but well let's say I am a n00b and am allowed to make mistakes) :D
Now I have to learn markdown which is probably a good thing, unless I can write blog posts in different formats. Note to self: search to see if we can write blogs in LaTeX.</description></item></channel></rss>
