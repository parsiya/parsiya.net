In this part, we are going to investigate DVTA to see what, how, and where it stores data. We are also going to do some basic DLL hijacking. Our tools are procmon, PowerSploit, and dnSpy.&lt;/p>

We will learn how to capture and modify network traffic using dnSpy. This is much easier than trying to intercept and modify traffic after it's transmitted.&lt;/p>

More often than not, thick client applications have some sort of network connectivity. They talk to some server(s) to do things.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>In this section, we will bypass the certificate pinning, enable the login button, learn how to modify the code in dnSpy through writing C# code and get a quick intro to Common Intermediate Language (CIL).&lt;/p>

However, I have not done more than a few practical examples that I can show my co-workers or anyone else asking questions. Recently, I came across the Damn Vulnerable Thick Client Application by SecVulture at &lt;a href="https://github.com/secvulture/dvta" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://github.com/secvulture/dvta&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I am not going to use the original version of the application. Someone has created a fork and added more protections. We will use this fork instead:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://github.com/nddmars/dvta" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://github.com/nddmars/dvta&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Neither fork's setup instructions worked for me. As a result, the first part is actually setting up the application and the necessary back-end in only one VM. But don't worry, we will do a bit of reverse engineering with dnSpy to fix an issue.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Thanks to SecVulture for creating the app and maintainers of the second repository for adding protections.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
