In short, I write most of my notes in markdown so I wanted to grab them and store them in a specific format with annotations (e.g. everything under heading &lt;code>deployment notes&lt;/code> is labeled as such in the final data file). These are not high volume, large files. I have written them manually, I am talking about a 10-20 KB file (with most content being pasted code/request snippets). I am not looking for efficiency.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://godoc.org/gopkg.in/russross/blackfriday.v2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Blackfriday&lt;/a> is the markdown parser for &lt;a href="https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hugo&lt;/a>, so I was somewhat familiar with it. Since version 2, it has a markdown parser.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this post, I am going to describe what I learned during the process and how I leveraged Blackfriday's markdown parser in some hacky ways to get annotated data. To visualize the AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) generated by Blackfriday, I used &lt;a href="https://github.com/awalterschulze/gographviz" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gographviz&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A simple package &lt;code>parse&lt;/code> and code can be found here:&lt;/p>

I think it took me around a month from start to finish with some stuff in the middle. Most were nice, some were tedious. For example, the last exercise was about &lt;a href="https://gophercises.com/exercises/pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PDF generation&lt;/a> and went to boring quickly.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Disclaimer: I loved the city and most people in it but I hated the Taxis and most shopkeepers. Once we started using public transport, the quality of our experience went up drastically.&lt;/p>

&lt;/h1>&lt;p>Instead of creating an index manually for Github, I am using a Hugo blog for my knowledge base (a.k.a. &lt;code>Parsia-Clone&lt;/code>). This blog is about my flow and how I have semi-automated the process. Demo site is at &lt;a href="https://parsiya.io" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://parsiya.io&lt;/a> (it's served in plaintext because I am making rapid changes and do not want to invalidate CloudFront's cache after every push).&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="flow">Flow
&lt;a class="header-link" href="#flow">&lt;svg class="fill-current o-60 hover-accent-color-light" height="22px" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="22px" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">&lt;path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/>&lt;path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76 0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71 0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71 0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76 0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"/>&lt;/svg>&lt;/a>
&lt;/h1>&lt;p>Flow is pretty simple:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Create the page bundle directory and page in the clone with &lt;code>hugo new&lt;/code>. I usually create it under &lt;code>categories\main-category-name&lt;/code>. The command will look like:
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;code>hugo new categories\research\hacking-the-gibson\index.md&lt;/code>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Run &lt;code>hugo serve&lt;/code> to preview the page during the edit.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Fill front matter and write the page in &lt;code>index.md&lt;/code>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Any resources such as pictures and files can be in the same directory. This helps in two ways, they can be referenced in the page (like pictures) and seen on Github (like config files).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When done, &lt;code>git add/commit/push&lt;/code> the clone inside the &lt;code>content&lt;/code> directory.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>???&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Profit. See updated blog, built and deployed by &lt;code>Travis CI&lt;/code>.&lt;/li>

Not having done this before, I encountered some pitfalls. Additionally I had two extra problems:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The structure of the blog is different from most Hugo deployments. &lt;a href="https://github.com/parsiya/Parsia-Clone" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Parsia-Clone&lt;/a> only contains the &lt;code>content&lt;/code> directory. Parents and everything else are in the &lt;a href="https://github.com/parsiya/Parsiya.io" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">parsiya.io&lt;/a> repo. So while we push to &lt;code>Parsia-Clone&lt;/code>, we need to clone &lt;code>parsiya.io&lt;/code> and build the repository there.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I am hosting it out of an S3 bucket. All other examples were using github pages.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Update November 2020:&lt;/strong> As of late November 2020, I have switched to Github
actions for both &lt;code>parsiya.net&lt;/code> and &lt;code>parsiya.io&lt;/code>. Please see
&lt;a href="https://github.com/parsiya/Parsia-Clone/blob/main/.github/workflows/deploy.ymlOLD" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">deploy.ymlOLD&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Update February 2021:&lt;/strong> parsiya.io is now hosted on github pages with a custom
domain instead of an S3 bucket. Please see the workflow file at
&lt;a href="https://github.com/parsiya/Parsia-Clone/blob/main/.github/workflows/gh-pages.yml" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gh-pages.yml&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Adding Custom Chroma Styles to Hugo Themes</title><link>https://parsiya.net/blog/2018-04-15-adding-custom-chroma-styles-to-hugo-themes/</link><pubDate>Sun, 15 Apr 2018 13:38:57 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://parsiya.net/blog/2018-04-15-adding-custom-chroma-styles-to-hugo-themes/</guid><description>&lt;p>Update: &lt;a href="https://github.com/alecthomas/chroma" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chroma&lt;/a> now &lt;a href="https://github.com/alecthomas/chroma/pull/140" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">supports&lt;/a> &lt;code>solarized-dark&lt;/code> families. Currently, this version is not used in Hugo.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Hugo has switched to &lt;a href="https://github.com/alecthomas/chroma" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chroma&lt;/a> for syntax highlighting from Pygments. While it still supports Pygments, it appears Chroma is much faster. However, Chroma does not support the &lt;a href="https://github.com/john2x/solarized-pygment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">solarized dark&lt;/a> theme that is used by &lt;a href="https://github.com/parsiya/Hugo-Octopress" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hugo-Octopress&lt;/a>. So I had to generate the CSS and add it manually.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The process is decently simple because Chroma has a &lt;a href="https://github.com/alecthomas/chroma#styles" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">built-in tool for converting styles&lt;/a> &lt;code>_tools/style.py&lt;/code>. You can see the files inside my clone:&lt;/p>

It's time to actually proxy applications. However I have three problems:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>I was too busy at work.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I could not find a lot of interesting applications that are interesting to proxy and can showcase different Burp functionalities that we talked about.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I found some interesting applications but there were security vulns so I am going through disclosure (unfortunately I may never be able to release them publicly).&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>The last point was a surprise, these are decently popular apps and I could not believe that no one has looked at them before.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Nevertheless, I will continue soon.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the meanwhile, Burp version &lt;code>1.7&lt;/code> has been &lt;a href="http://releases.portswigger.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released&lt;/a>. Now we have Burp projects. Instead of saving the state everyday, we can use one project file that contains all the items. Pretty cool. Some of the items have changed, especially options. Now it has &lt;code>User Options&lt;/code> and &lt;code>Project Options&lt;/code> but the options by themselves are still there.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Cloudfront and TLS</title><link>https://parsiya.net/blog/2016-04-14-cloudfront-and-tls/</link><pubDate>Thu, 14 Apr 2016 20:45:15 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://parsiya.net/blog/2016-04-14-cloudfront-and-tls/</guid><description>&lt;p>I finally decided to cave in and take advantage of the Amazon Cloudfront free TLS certificate. I know I will end up paying more than what I already do but I pay few bucks each month. Each month I pay one dollar for two hosted zones and another dollar or so for the bandwidth. Even if I was still in my home country, I would have been able to pay this as it is less than a large pizza even where I lived.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you are interested in free hosting alternatives, you can use &lt;a href="https://gohugo.io/tutorials/github-pages-blog/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Github-pages&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://gohugo.io/tutorials/hosting-on-bitbucket/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bitbucket&lt;/a> or just go with the excellent &lt;a href="https://gitlab.com/pages/hugo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gitlab-Pages&lt;/a> (which supports Hugo and whole lot of other static website generators natively).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It took me a lot of tries and probably burning a good amount of money on Cloudfront invalidation requests (otherwise I had to wait for a day or so to see the changes) but it finally worked. The trick was to setup the origin policy during creation of the distribution as it cannot be modified through the web portal after that.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Burp part five is still on hold for now because I am doing something else.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Hugo Octopress Update</title><link>https://parsiya.net/blog/2016-04-03-hugo-octopress-update/</link><pubDate>Sun, 03 Apr 2016 13:13:39 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://parsiya.net/blog/2016-04-03-hugo-octopress-update/</guid><description>&lt;p>I have made a good number of changes to the &lt;a href="https://github.com/parsiya/hugo-octopress" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hugo-Octopress&lt;/a> theme. As I have been using the theme more and more, I have realized there were a bunch of bugs (some were pointed out on Github).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Apart from Bugs, I had hardcoded too many settings in the theme. For example, modifying the text in the sidebar could only be accomplished by changing the sidebar template. Ideally user should not need to modify anything in the theme and it should be customizable by just using the config file.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the end I created a bunch of issues on Github and then closed them myself. I am not quite sure if this is correct &lt;code>git&lt;/code> but eh :D&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Archive Page in Hugo</title><link>https://parsiya.net/blog/2016-02-14-archive-page-in-hugo/</link><pubDate>Sun, 14 Feb 2016 20:52:45 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://parsiya.net/blog/2016-02-14-archive-page-in-hugo/</guid><description>&lt;p>This is a re-hash of my answer on Hugo forums about creating a custom archive page.

&lt;p>Creating a custom archive page in Hugo is pretty simple. I think there are better ways to do this but this works as of version 0.15.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>From Octopress to Hugo</title><link>https://parsiya.net/blog/2016-02-02-from-octopress-to-hugo/</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 Feb 2016 22:58:26 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://parsiya.net/blog/2016-02-02-from-octopress-to-hugo/</guid><description>&lt;p>In &lt;a href="https://parsiya.net/blog/2016-01-31-why-hugo/" title="Why Hugo?">my previous post&lt;/a> I talked about why I moved from Octopress to Hugo. You can also see the last archive of my Octopress blog (previously a private repo on Bitbucket) on &lt;a href="https://github.com/parsiya/Octopress-Blog" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">github&lt;/a> and this is the new site. If I had wanted to use an already existing Hugo theme, it would have not taken more than a few hours.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this post I am going to talk about how I managed the migration and any interesting things that I encountered in the process. I will also introduce the &lt;a href="https://github.com/parsiya/hugo-octopress/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hugo-Octopress&lt;/a> theme (you are looking at it), which is the classic Octopress theme ported to Hugo. If you like what you see, please go ahead and use it. If there are any issues please use the &lt;a href="https://github.com/parsiya/Hugo-Octopress/issues" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Github issue tracker&lt;/a> or contact me another way. I will try my best to fix them but please remember that I am not a developer and do not know much about css :).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Why Hugo?</title><link>https://parsiya.net/blog/2016-01-31-why-hugo/</link><pubDate>Sun, 31 Jan 2016 20:22:19 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://parsiya.net/blog/2016-01-31-why-hugo/</guid><description>&lt;p>As you may have noticed (well no one reads this so I am fine), I have moved from &lt;a href="http://octopress.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Octopress&lt;/a> to &lt;a href="https://gohugo.io" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hugo&lt;/a>.

However, it is still in the repository.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I finally realized that I need an image popup plugin. The image plugins that I usually use do not support this. They are fine for normal images but not for larger ones. When I see a screenshot of a tool, I want to be able to zoom in. In my quest I looked at a few plugins and methods and finally decided to use &lt;a href="https://github.com/ctdk/octopress-image-popup" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://github.com/ctdk/octopress-image-popup&lt;/a>. It creates resized thumbnails automatically and the installation procedure is short and simple.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, it did not work for me out of the box. I created a test post with just an image and while the plugin worked, there are things that I did not like about it.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Amazon S3 and CSS</title><link>https://parsiya.net/blog/2014-04-22-amazon-s3-and-css/</link><pubDate>Tue, 22 Apr 2014 14:03:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://parsiya.net/blog/2014-04-22-amazon-s3-and-css/</guid><description>&lt;p>After I deployed my blog to Amazon S3, I realized that there was no CSS applied to the pages.

I looked around for a few hours to no avail.

Although compared to writing LaTeX source, it is a breeze. During my last year at JHU I started writing the reports and what not directly into LaTeX,
I think using MarkDown for blogging and MS Office at work is going to take away my old skills.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On a side note, I am now up to around 500 million cookies per second (CpS) in
&lt;strong>&lt;a href="http://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cookie Clicker&lt;/a>&lt;/strong>. I was stuck at 200 million CpS for a week or so until I could start making Antimatter Condensers. I may have missed them before
as they were not visible in the side-bar and I had to scroll down to see them.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Hello Octopress</title><link>https://parsiya.net/blog/2013-09-14-hello-octopress/</link><pubDate>Sat, 14 Sep 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://parsiya.net/blog/2013-09-14-hello-octopress/</guid><description>&lt;p>** Octopress is here **&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To be honest setting it up took a while (I had this feeling that I should set it up on my host but well let's say I am a n00b and am allowed to make mistakes) :D&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now I have to learn markdown which is probably a good thing, unless I can write blog posts in different formats. Note to self: search to see if we can write blogs in LaTeX. That would be too geeky.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
