When I wanted to write a custom proxy tool (it's a simple Python script) in &lt;a href="https://parsiya.net/blog/2015-10-19-proxying-hipchat-part-3-ssl-added-and-removed-here/" title="Proxying Hipchat Part 3: SSL Added and Removed Here"&gt;Hipchat part3&lt;/a&gt;, I had to go back and learn how they work. I did not find such a resource online that looked at proxies from an infosec perspective. Most talked about how to configure caching or forwarding proxies and not much about MitM ones. I have briefly talked about it in the section 2 of the same post named &lt;code&gt;How does a Proxy Work?&lt;/code&gt;. In this post I am going to take a deep(er) dive. I actually read some RFCs and they were surprisingly well written.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to skip the intro, go to &lt;a href="#section-3" title="How HTTP Proxies Work"&gt;section 3&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
